Despite extensive research, an understanding of the underlying mechanisms that drive normal behaviors and response to disease states is still limited. Advancement in the Neuroscience field and development of therapeutics for related pathologies requires innovative technologies that can provide a dynamic and systematic understanding of the interactions between neurons and neural circuits. In this work, we provide an up-to-date overview of the evolution of neurophotonic approaches in the last 10 years through a multi-source, literature analysis. From an initial corpus of 243 papers retrieved from Scopus, PubMed and WoS databases, we have followed the PRISMA approach to select 56 papers in the area. Following a full-text evaluation of these 56 scientific articles, six main areas of applied research were identified and discussed: (1) Advanced optogenetics, (2) Multimodal neural interfaces, (3) Innovative therapeutics, (4) Imaging devices and probes, (5) Remote operations, and (6) Microfluidic platforms. For each area, the main technologies selected are discussed according to the photonic principles applied, the neuroscience application evaluated and the more indicative results of efficiency and scientific potential. This detailed analysis is followed by an outlook of the main challenges tackled over the last 10 years in the Neurophotonics field, as well as the main technological advances regarding specificity, light delivery, multimodality, imaging, materials and system designs. We conclude with a discussion of considerable challenges for future innovation and translation in Neurophotonics, from light delivery within the brain to physical constraints and data management strategies.

However, when the relationship between moving parts of equipment is complex, both instantaneous failure and long-period degradation should be considered. Existing research is challenging to describe the dynamic evolution of the health status of the target object at varied time scales. In addition, data characteristics at different time scales are difficult to be captured simultaneously by current methods. This paper proposes an innovative dual time scale digital twin modeling and analysis method. According to the PHM business rules, the time series signals are decomposed into fine-grained scales and adaptively constructed into short time scale and long time scale digital twins. The generated events of different scales pay attention to the temporal characteristics and uncertainties, and interactive mapping of events at different scales is realized in cyberspace. Events at a short time scale focus on the real-time occurrence of anomalies, and long-term events track equipment degradation and trends. The interaction and collaboration between different time scale models are also discussed. Finally, the paper uses the state monitoring of large cranes in iron and steel enterprises to verify the proposed method. The results show that this modeling method can reduce the uncertainty and incompleteness of system monitoring in a complex system. Real-time performance and reliability of equipment health diagnosis have been effectively improved. © 2023 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers","Digital Twin; Event-driven; Long Short-Term Digital Twins; PHM; Time scales","Signal processing; Time measurement; 'current; Different time scale; Event-driven; Long short-term digital twin; Management research; Model method; Prognostic and health management; Short time scale; Single event; Time-scales; Uncertainty analysis","J.

A few massive, irregularly shaped slabs of rock known as tectonic plates are present inside the Earth which are always under a slow and continuous motion. However, in some cases they might get stuck at their edges as a result of friction. When the stress on the edges of the tectonic plates overcomes the friction, it causes an earthquake which releases energy due to which shaking is felt during an earthquake. There are not many well-defined prediction methods. However, usually a long-term analysis of the earthquakes in a specific location is used for predicting an earthquake. The proposed work is to model a real-time streaming application using Apache Kafka, Apache Spark, MongoDB, and Dash that can help in the prediction and real-time analytics of the seismic data.

This unexpected data volume needs significant effort to manage, structure, save, and process to produce effective information and best utilize it. Extracting valuable knowledge from this heterogonous data is a high demanding need. Making accurate decisions based on this data was a dream in the near past. Data management and handling data heterogeneity locally on sensor boards and regionally on local servers using Fog and centrally on Cloud acts as an enabler for giving IoT an excellent value even if it faces many complexities and challenges, as discussed in this paper. Moreover, data management in IoT is a serious issue due to communication among billions of devices, which generate massive datasets. Data analysis on such a big volume of data is a difficult undertaking due to the lack of any standard. A definition of IoT-based data should be established to determine what is available and how it can be used. A study like this also points to the need for innovative approaches to deal with such problems. It's a great difficulty to cope with such a range of data as IoT delivers processing nodes in the form of smart nodes due to the heterogeneity of linked nodes, varied data rates, and formats. The Industrial IoT involves real-time analysis of data from interconnected sensor devices. It provides a solid foundation for big data research. Real-time data streaming adds an extra dimension of complexity and involves some more challenges. we briefly outline current open issues of edge computing and cloud computing platforms based on our literature survey for IoT data streaming heterogeneity. Finally, we propose Fog of Things Framework as a solution for all these challenges. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Big data; Cloud computing; Data heterogeneity; Data management; Data streaming; Edge computing; Fog computing; Internet of things; Real-time data","Big data; Data reduction; Edge computing; Fog; Fog computing; Internet of things; Cloud-computing; Data heterogeneity; Data streaming; Data volume; Decision-based; Edge computing; Innovative approaches; Local servers; Massive data sets; Real-time data; Information management","S.

AI can overcome the challenges that complex topologies like those of the low voltage (LV) smart grids pose and prove to be a powerful tool in the development of advanced fault diagnosis methods. An important parameter for the success of any AI-based method is the quality of data. Therefore, in this paper a data analysis is performed in order to evaluate the type of data produced by a small LV grid and an representative AI algorithm's response to those. In the context of this analysis, the most important features and meters were identified. Furthermore, as a response to the large volume of available data, a data management strategy is proposed. The strategy combines original and reshaped features. For this purpose, five dimensionality reduction methods are tested and compared. Truncated-SVD is deemed the most appropriate and is subsequently utilized for the reshaping of the dataset that is introduced to the XGBoost fault location model. The integration of the dimensionality reduction technique in the algorithm results in the decrease of the computational time and the dataset's size and in a higher generalizability of the algorithm. Thus, the application of the proposed method is not limited by the grid's topology. The method's robustness was verified against various influencing parameters such as the fault resistance, the size of the dataset, the loss of data and the photovoltaics’ penetration level. The overall algorithm achieved a mean squared error of 13.26 and a training and test accuracy of more than 99% when tested on the CIGRE LV benchmark grid. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Data analysis; Dimensionality reduction; Fault location; Low voltage grid; Machine learning","Data reduction; Electric fault location; Electric power transmission networks; Failure analysis; Fault detection; Information analysis; Information management; Location; Mean square error; Topology; Complex topology; Dimensionality reduction; Electricity grids; Fault diagnosis schemes; Fault location algorithms; Grid fault; Low voltages; Low-voltage grid; Optimal applications; Practical solutions; Machine learning","P.

Existing approaches only focused on stand-alone database servers, while we are interested in modeling energy consumption of database operations in the distributed environments. In this study, we aim at providing an accurate energy consumption model for queries executed in distributed database systems, profiling energy consumption characteristics of both the individual queries and the system as a whole, to guide the design of green database systems and to reveal opportunities for energy-efficient computing. As the execution of a distributed query is a combination of a set of subqueries that decomposed from it, we start from building energy models for individual subqueries by extracting basic operations that can effectively reflect their energy consumption. Then we use a bottom-up measuring and modeling method as the basis to provide a comprehensive energy estimation model for the entire distributed query. To validate the accuracy of the model, we use queries with a variety complexity that generated from three standard benchmarks (TPC-H, SSB, and Sysbench) on real distributed databases. Extensive experimental results show that our solution can achieve a high average accuracy of 94.63% for distributed queries. More importantly, based on these results we further explored energy consumption patterns for distributed queries and presented several important implications. And finally, a significant role of distributed joins has been discovered in saving both idle and dynamic energy cost of the system. We hope that taking advantage of our observations can help readers who wish to substantially improve energy efficiency for distributed database systems. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","Distributed database systems; Energy estimation; Energy-efficient computing; Query optimization","Distributed database systems; Energy efficiency; Green computing; Query languages; Query processing; Bottom up; Building energy; Comprehensive energy model; Distributed query; Energy efficient; Energy estimation; Energy-consumption; Energy-efficient computing; Queries optimization; Sub-queries; Energy utilization","B.

However, their usefulness is constrained by the amount and quality of biodiversity data and the approaches for dealing with data deficiencies. Presence-only data, used in presence/background modelling methods, are widely available but are often affected by sampling bias. Presence/absence modelling methods are less affected by biases, but data are less common. We modelled the distribution of a widely distributed, endangered species from Australia – the greater glider – and tested how predictions were influenced by data treatment and modelling framework. We collated available species data and fitted generalized linear models and boosted regression trees using presence/absence data, as well as using an augmented dataset that included additional presences alongside absences inferred from survey data. We also fitted presence/background models, adopting three common strategies for bias correction. We compared model performance quantitatively through evaluation metrics calculated internally and on held out data, and qualitatively by identifying areas of agreement of spatial predictions. We found that presence/background models with bias correction performed better than not corrected, though evaluation metrics did not favour a single strategy. Presence/absence models outperformed presence/background models in comparable metrics and delivered different spatial predictions. Importantly, differences in spatial predictions between models had the potential to substantially alter decisions about where to protect high-quality habitat. The approach to inferring absences proved useful, as models fitted with these outperformed all other models. Dealing with sampling bias requires additional time and data management strategies, but we found that the time invested allowed improvement of models and more reliable predictions. Our results suggest that ancillary occurrence data and careful data handling can improve both presence/background and presence/absence models. © 2024 The Authors.

To deal with the problem, we proposed a rear axle assembly torque online control method based on digital twin. First, the gray wolf-based optimization variational modal decomposition and long short-term memory network (GWO-VMD-LSTM) algorithm was raised to predict the assembly torque of the rear axle, which solves the shortcomings of unpredictable non-stationarity and nonlinear assembly torque, and the prediction accuracy reaches 99.49% according to the experimental results. Next, the evaluation indexes of support vector machine (SVM), recurrent neural network (RNN), LSTM, and SVM, RNN, and LSTM based on gray wolf optimized variational modal decomposition (GWO-VMD) were compared, and the performance of the GWO-VMD-LSTM is the best. For the purpose of solving the insufficient information interaction capability problem of the assembly line, we developed a digital twin system for the rear axle assembly line to realize the visualization and monitoring of the assembly process. Finally, the assembly torque prediction model is coupled with the digital twin system to realize real-time prediction and online control of assembly torque, and the experimental testing manifests that the response time of the system is about 1 s. Consequently, the digital twin-based rear axle assembly torque prediction and online control method can significantly improve the assembly quality and assembly efficiency, which is of great significance to promote the construction of intelligent production line. © 2022 by the authors.","digital twin; gray wolf optimized variational modal decomposition; long short-term memory networks; online control; torque prediction","Algorithms; Animals; Neural Networks, Computer; Support Vector Machine; Torque; Wolves; Assembly machines; Brain; Efficiency; Forecasting; Long short-term memory; Quality control; Support vector machines; Torque; Assembly process; Assembly quality; Gray wolf optimized variational modal decomposition; Gray wolves; Long short-term memory network; Memory network; Modal decomposition; On-line controls; Prediction control; Torque prediction; adult; article; assembly line; Canis lupus; decomposition; digital twin; long short term memory network; nonhuman; online monitoring; prediction; production line; reaction time; recurrent neural network; support vector machine; torque; Assembly","Z.

Privacy in the metaverse is a critical concern as the concept evolves and immersive virtual experiences become more prevalent. The metaverse privacy problem refers to the challenges and concerns surrounding the privacy of personal information and data within Virtual Reality (VR) environments as the concept of a shared VR space becomes more accessible. Metaverse will harness advancements from various technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Extended Reality (XR) and Mixed Reality (MR) to provide personalized and immersive services to its users. Moreover, to enable more personalized experiences, the metaverse relies on the collection of fine-grained user data that leads to various privacy issues. Therefore, before the potential of the metaverse can be fully realized, privacy concerns related to personal information and data within VR environments must be addressed. This includes safeguarding users’ control over their data, ensuring the security of their personal information, and protecting in-world actions and interactions from unauthorized sharing. In this paper, we explore various privacy challenges that future metaverses are expected to face, given their reliance on AI for tracking users, creating XR and MR experiences, and facilitating interactions.

The model is controlled according to adaptive measurements and transmission periods. The controller's reward policy evaluates the level of charge available to the device. The controller applies and evaluates various learning parameters and reduces the learning rate over time. Using four years of historical soil temperature data in an experimental simulation of several controller configurations, the DQL controller demonstrated correct operation, a low learning rate, and high cumulative rewards.

Recent improvements in Data Lake technology have focused on improving data access, governance, and discoverability. However, the energy consumption of data operations, a non-trivial issue for eco-conscious organizations, is currently overlooked. Furthermore, existing monitoring tools do not adequately address the complexities of Data Lake architectures. This paper presents the initial phase of developing a system for measuring energy in Data Lake pipeline operations. The novelty of our solution lies in the fact that we define four measures to assess the power usage of crucial hardware components in a Data Lake context: CPU, RAM, NIC, and storage devices.

Yet, according to recent research, our ability to collect and store massive amounts of data far outstrips our ability to manage and analyse ever-increasing data, such as data exchange, information sharing, and multi-dimensional data fusion. In this paper, in order to facilitate the development of automated visualisation and multidimensional data-oriented analytics, we propose a visual analytics-oriented data diagram and data processing workflows. Firstly, we introduce visual model data as a new modality in data management and analytics by standardising drawing data. Then, we extend the visual analytics into 3D spaces for enhanced interactive visualization and various data access. This also enables the development of a new schema for a comprehensive data-driven model for visualisation, which can be an alternative to the conventional solid model and perform well in scalability and lifetime support. Furthermore, based on the unified data diagram and tile index concept, a multidimensional and multimodality data management strategy is proposed for system scalability and lifetime support. Lastly, effective data management targeting data fusion and 3D visual analytics is implemented, providing constant data support in the trial of mining digitalization.

The optimization of GPU feature configuration is a complex subject that significantly impacts a system’s energy consumption and performance efficiency. The primary objectives of this study are to examine and improve the energy consumption characteristics of GPUs, which play a crucial role in the functioning of blockchains and the mining of cryptocurrencies. This study examines the complex relationship between GPU configurations and system architecture components and their effects on energy efficiency and sustainability. The methodology of this study conducts experiments involving various GPU models and mining software, evaluating their effectiveness across various configurations and environments. Multilinear regression analysis is used to study the complex relationships between critical performance indicators like power consumption, thermal dynamics, core speed, and hash rate and their effects on energy efficiency and performance. The results reveal that strategically adjusting GPU hardware, software, and configuration can preserve substantial energy while preserving computational efficiency. GPU core speed, temperature, core memory speed, ETASH algorithms, fan speed, and energy usage significantly affected the dependent computational-efficiency variable (p = 0.000 and R2 = 0.962) using multilinear regression analysis. GPU core speed, temperature, core memory speed, fan speed, and energy usage significantly affected efficient energy usage (p = 0.000 and R2 = 0.989).

Rising costs and energy demands can cause serious problems. Fog computing (FC) has recently emerged as a model for location-aware tasks, data processing, fast computing, and energy consumption reduction. The Fog computing model assists cloud computing in fast processing at the network's edge, which also exerts a vital role in cloud computing. Due to the fast computing in fog servers, different quality of service (QoS) approaches have been proposed in various sections of the fog system, and several quality factors have been considered in this regard. Despite the significance of QoS in Fog computing, no extensive study has focused on QoS and energy consumption methods in this area. Therefore, this article investigates previous research on the use and guarantee of Fog computing. This article reviews six general approaches that discuss the published articles between 2015 and late May 2023. The focal point of this paper is evaluating Fog computing and the energy consumption strategy. This article further shows the advantages, disadvantages, tools, types of evaluation, and quality factors according to the selected approaches.

Herein, we present autonomous millimeter scale high-throughput battery research system (Auto-MISCHBARES) operated with an asynchronous web-based orchestration framework that integrates modular research instrumentation designed for autonomous electrochemical experimentation. The platform allows researchers to define a range of experiments with granular parameter control, start the process, and receive a live visualization of measurements through a web-based user interface. This paper presents a proof of concept for cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) formation in lithium-ion batteries (LiBs) at various potentials, all controlled through Auto-MISCHBARES and correlating its high-throughput electrochemistry results with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) characterization. We believe quality control, complex data analysis, and management to be the missing puzzle pieces toward more complex workflow automation. Auto-MISCHBARES integrates automatic quality control for both hardware and software using AI enablers to ensure high reliability through an on-the-fly fidelity assessment of each experiment. In the presented case study, voltammetry measurements are handled through a modular platform capable of performing fully automated analysis, while data lineage is provided through relational data storage in adherence with Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) guidelines, all in real-time. Thus, Auto-MISCHBARES represents a point of contact between the orchestration of automated instrumentation, quality control, real-time data analysis, and management, enabling reproducible and versatile workflows for the discovery of new materials, especially for batteries.

The Spark platform makes it possible to build a distributed computing environment for big data processing on a single computer. When the K-means algorithm built in Spark platform is used for digital images processing, the Spark Shuffle resilient distributed dataset (RDD) partition generally adopts the default setting. Although this RDD setup is simple and convenient, it is easy to cause the phenomenon of “excessive partition and too little data”in the large scale images segmentation task, which greatly affects the image segmentation speed. Therefore, this paper utilizes the built-in K-means algorithm for segmenting the WorldView-3 images coving part of Shanghai city, which properly defines the RDD partition parameter spark.sql.shuffle.partitions during the initializing clustering centers stage and adaptively calls the coalesce() operator to adjust the number of RDD partitions during iteration. Comparing with the serial K-means algorithm, the feasibility and effectiveness of single computer processing of big data are verified. Comparing with the Spark parallel K-means algorithm with the parameters for the default setting, the proposed algorithm can realize large-scale image segmentation faster. The experimental results show that, in the both stages of initialization and iterative computation of cluster centers for the K-means algorithm, the RDD partition number is set at 1-10 times of the CPU core number, which reduces the total time from 145s before optimization to 97s. Especially in the time efficiency of the initializing cluster center stage, the time efficiency after optimization is 500-1000 times that before optimization. © 2024 Northeast University.

With the emergence of the big data age, along with the data-centric and data-intensive computing trend, the great amount of energy consumed by database systems has become a major concern in a society that pursues Green IT. However, to the best of our knowledge, despite the importance of this matter in Green IT, there have been few comprehensive or systematic studies conducted in this field. Therefore, the objective of this article is to present a literature survey with breadth and depth on existing energy management techniques for database systems. The existing literature is organized hierarchically with two major branches focusing separately on energy consumption models and energy-saving techniques. Under each branch, we first introduce some basic knowledge, then we classify, discuss, and compare existing research according to their core ideas, basic approaches, and main characteristics. Finally, based on these observations through our study, we identify multiple open issues and challenges, and provide insights for future research. It is our hope that our outcome of this work will help researchers develop more energy-efficient database systems. © 2022 Association for Computing Machinery.","database systems; energy consumption modeling; energy efficiency; energy management; energy proportionality; Green computing","Database systems; Energy management; Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Green computing; Data centric; Data-intensive computing; Economic costs; Energy; Energy consumption model; Energy efficient; Energy proportionalities; Green-IT; Literature survey; Systematic study; Energy efficiency","B.

Using a database of historical vibration signals, partial failure due to misalignment is diagnosed by Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) analysis. This partial failure can evolve into a total failure, leading to the cessation of production and higher maintenance costs. Predictive maintenance can improve its ability to predict failure phenomena using data-driven degradation modeling. On this basis, a total failure of a gas turbine can be avoided. A set of temporal and frequency health indicators are extracted at each operating cycle to be analyzed, filtered, and improved using statistical techniques such as normalization methods and correlation analysis. Additionally, the rolling average is used based on window functions and monotonicity to choose the best and most reliable indicators. Before fitting the decay curves of the selected health indicators using an exponential regression model, they were combined into a single indicator by applying the principal component analysis (PCA) technique to facilitate the adjustment process. The results showed good performance after testing the exponential model to predict the RUL on the test data. © ASM International 2024.","Diagnostic; Exponential model; Gas turbine; Misalignment; Prognostic; Remaining useful life","Alignment; Correlation methods; Curve fitting; Fast Fourier transforms; Gas turbines; Maintenance; Principal component analysis; Regression analysis; Signal processing; Supervised learning; Vibration analysis; Diagnostic; Diagnostics management; Exponential degradation models; Exponential models; Health indicators; Machinery maintenance; Misalignment; Partial failure; Prognostic; Remaining useful lives; Forecasting","M.

The complex working environment will lead to frequent failure of servo drive systems. Taking effective health management measures is the key to ensure the normal operation of CNC machine tools. In this paper, the comprehensive effect of fault prediction and fault diagnosis is considered for the first time, and a health management system for machine tool servo drive systems is proposed and applied to operation and maintenance management. According to the data collected by the system and related indicators, the technology can predict the state trend of equipment operation, identify the hidden fault characteristics in the data, and further diagnose the fault types. A health management system mainly includes fault prediction and fault diagnosis. The core of fault prediction is the gated recurrent unit (GRU). The attention mechanism is introduced into a GRU neural network, which can solve the long-term dependence problem and improve the model performance. At the same time, the Nadam optimizer is used to update the model parameters, which improves the convergence speed and generalization ability of the model and makes it suitable for solving the prediction problem of large-scale data. The core of fault diagnosis is the self-organizing mapping (SOM) neural network, which performs cluster analysis on data with different characteristics, to realize fault diagnosis. In addition, feature standardization and principal component analysis (PCA) are introduced to balance the influence of different feature scales, enhance the feature of fault data, and achieve data dimensionality reduction. Compared with the other two algorithms and their improved versions, the superiority of the health management system with high-dimensional data and the enhancement effect of fault identification are verified. The relative relationship between fault prediction and diagnosis is further revealed, and the adjustment idea of the production plan is provided for decision makers. The rationality and effectiveness of the system in practical application are verified by a series of tests of fault data sets. © 2024 by the authors.","failure prediction; fault diagnosis; GRU; health management; machine tool servo drive system; PHM; SOM","","T.

Within this landscape, the efficient management of computationally intensive tasks in satellite-enabled mist computing environments emerges as a critical challenge. These tasks, spanning from optimizing satellite communication to facilitating blockchain-based IoT processes, necessitate substantial computational resources and timely execution. To address this challenge, we introduce APOLLO, a novel low-layer orchestration algorithm explicitly tailored for satellite mist computing environments. APOLLO leverages proximity-driven decision-making and load balancing to optimize task deployment and performance. We assess APOLLO’s efficacy across various configurations of mist-layer devices while employing a round-robin principle for equitable tasks distribution among the close, low-layer satellites. Our findings underscore APOLLO’s promising outcomes in terms of reduced energy consumption, minimized end-to-end delay, and optimized network resource utilization, particularly in targeted scenarios. However, the evaluation also reveals avenues for refinement, notably in CPU utilization and slightly low task success rates.

It is widely used due to its high-performance caching mechanism and high scalability. In the face of the unpredictability of data access patterns in the current big data environment, the data shuffling phase is prone to the problems of under-utilization of Spark cluster resources, high computational latency, and high task processing latency. Based on this, this paper proposes an intermediate data management strategy based on the data shuffling phase. Firstly, the size of the data generated in the data shuffling phase of the Spark platform is predicted by random sampling. The strength division strategy obtains the skewed data degree to obtain the part with excessive skew deviation. Finally, the adaptive data management strategy is applied to perform the corresponding computation tasks by the data deviation. In addition, to improve the response time, memory usage, and computation latency of Spark applications, an adaptive cache replacement algorithm based on RDD partition weights is proposed, which takes into account the influence of four weight factors such as computation cost, usage times, partition size and life cycle of RDDs by reasonably calculating the RDD partition weight values. Compared with the current mainstream baseline algorithms, the data management algorithm based on the data mash-up phase proposed in this paper can effectively reduce resource usage and computational response latency. The RDD-based partition weighted adaptive cache replacement algorithm proposed in this paper can fully use memory resources and effectively reduce the problem of resource wastage. © 2022","Adaptive cache replacement; Cache gain; Data management; Data shuffling; RDD partition weights","Cache memory; Life cycle; 'current; Adaptive cache replacements; Cache gain; Cache replacement; Cache replacement algorithm; Data management strategies; Data shuffling; Internet users; RDD partition weight; Replacement strategy; Information management","C.

The servers consume most of the energy in the DC, but the network infrastructure also uses a great deal of energy. It is therefore necessary to minimize the energy consumption of DC. DC Energy Conservation Strategy has various directorates, including energy-efficient methods for servers and networks, blended for servers and networks, cooling and renewable energy. As the literature revealed, many existing ways are available, but there are many problems with the current strategies, such as the issues include loss of packets, systems with rigid approaches with low modifications, obsolete methodologies for newer hardware devices, methods tested on small networks, and the amount of energy saved compared to the risk and financial cost involved is not worth it. This research eliminates the risk of packet loss up to some extent by securing as well improving the network efficiency. The study aims to construct a way to save energy in DC by employing the software-defined networking technique and modifying the existing Elastic Tree to maximize power savings, minimize the performance effect, and guarantee fault tolerance. It can consider improving the existing optimizer in elastic tree methodology and introducing new factors like power control based on traffic pattern analysis. A Mininet emulator is utilized to develop a virtual DC network. An optimizer is designed using different models and includes a floodlight controller that monitors traffic flow and creates a custom network topology by tracking the traffic pattern in DC. This custom network topology keeps the network's essential components active and power down the unneeded parts, including many links and switches, to meet the best performance. The custom topology suggested demonstrating in J-Graph. This exploration further leads to optimizer analysis, a step toward improving smart energy conservation. © 2023 IEEE.","Artificial Intelligence (AI); Cloud DC; Data Centers; Deep Learning; Energy Conservation; Energy Efficiency; Power Efficiency; software-defined networking","Deep learning; Electric lighting; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Fault tolerance; Green computing; Network topology; Packet networks; Power control; Artificial intelligence; Cloud data centers; Datacenter; Deep learning; Energy; Energy-consumption; Optimizers; Power-efficiency; Smart energies; Software-defined networkings; Software defined networking","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","979-835033219-3","","","English","Int.

Yet, while the different data collection mechanisms might be effortless to construct, it is advised to have a well-balanced consideration of the possible data inputs based on the machine characteristics, usage, and operational environment. Prior consideration of the collected data parameters reduces the risk of excessive data, yet another challenge remains to distinguish meaningful features significant for the purpose. This research illustrates a peripheral milling machine data collection and data pre-processing approach to diagnose significant machine parameters relevant to milling blade wear. The experiences gained from this research encourage conducting pre-categorisation of data significant for the purpose, those being manual setup data, programmable logic controller (PLC) automation system data, calculated parameters, and measured parameters under this study. Further, the results from the raw data pre-processing phase performed with Pearson Correlation Coefficient and permutation feature importance methods indicate that the most dominant correlation to recognised wear characteristics in the case machine context is perceived with vibration excitation monitoring. The root mean square (RMS) vibration signal is further predicted by using the support vector regression (SVR) algorithm to test the SVR’s overall suitability for the asset’s health index (HI) approximation. It was found that the SVR algorithm has sufficient data parameter behaviour forecast capabilities to be used in the peripheral milling machine prognostic process and its development. The SVR with Gaussian radial basis function (RBF) kernel receives the highest scoring metrics; therefore, outperforming the linear and polynomial kernels compared as part of the study. © 2023 by the authors.","data collection; feature extraction; milling blade wear; Pearson correlation coefficient; peripheral milling; permutation feature importance; support vector regression","","T.

The traditional strategy of solely relying on access frequency for data classification is no longer suitable for today’s complex storage environment. Diverging from conventional methods, we explore from the perspective of text semantics to address this issue and propose an effective data classification storage method using text semantic similarity to extract seasonal features. First, we adopt a dual-layer strategy based on semantic similarity to extract seasonal features. Second, we put forward a cost-effective data classification storage framework based on text seasonal features. We compare our work with the data classification approach AS-H, which runs at full high performance. In addition, we also compare it with K-ear, which adopts K-means as the classification algorithm.

PHM consists of a variety of mathematical and computational methods used to support data-driven decision-making to increase the safety, availability, and reliability of complex engineering systems. In particular, PHM can provide crucial insight into reliability and safety design improvements for developing technologies where historical performance and failure data are limited. This is the case of hydrogen fueling and storage technologies. This work presents a high-level approach for designing data-driven PHM applications for bulk liquid hydrogen (LH2) storage systems for hydrogen fueling stations. This paper addresses core aspects of the design, development, and implementation of data-driven PHM applications that can improve the reliability assessment of hydrogen components. The analysis focuses on the relationship between data availability and diagnostic/prognostic capabilities; potential challenges; and integration schemes for current risk mitigation measures. We identify potential condition-monitoring data sources for key components in an LH2 storage system, including storage tanks, piping, and pumps. We determine that the short-term goals for the implementation of data-driven models in PHM frameworks in hydrogen systems should focus on developing adequate data collection and analysis strategies, as well as exploring the effect on reliability, safety, and regulations for hydrogen systems. © 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","Condition-monitoring data; Hydrogen safety; Liquid hydrogen storage; Prognostics and health management","Condition monitoring; Decision making; Digital storage; Hydrides; Information management; Liquefied gases; Reliability analysis; Risk assessment; Safety engineering; Condition-monitoring data; Data requirements; Data-driven prognostics; Hydrogen safety; Hydrogen storage system; Hydrogen system; Liquid hydrogen storage; Management applications; Prognostic and health management; Storage systems; Hydrogen storage","C.

This study focuses on the underexplored realm of Non-domestic Building Stock (NDBS), which constitutes 8% of global energy consumption and 11% of worldwide carbon emissions. Due to the long lifecycle of buildings, a comprehensive assessment of the NDBS is imperative to achieve the goal of net-zero carbon buildings by 2050. The current NDBS studies can be categorised into two groups based on the geographic location and type of building being studied. Each of these two different building stocks demonstrates different research and analysis tools, but specific comparisons have not yet been made between them. In addition, existing literature reviews of NDBS have mainly emphasised the technical aspects and neglected their social aspects. This study aims to critically review the energy and carbon footprint related efforts in NDBS research, assess the current state of research, and propose potential research trends. Based on inclusion and exclusion criteria, 99 out of 906 articles are fully reviewed. Utilising and adapting the Social-Technical Systems (STS) approach, this study analyses the data requirements, research methods, and research objectives of NDBS studies concerning energy consumption and carbon footprint from five perspectives, namely infrastructure, technology, processes, goals, and people. Results demonstrate that geo-stock and type-stock approaches, while focusing on different aspects of building stock, can share data and analysis methods to improve research efficiency and model accuracy. Additionally, findings highlight that incorporating socio-economic factors into technical models can enhance model robustness and output reliability, thereby supporting effective policy-making and energy management strategies. This study provides a new multidimensional approach to evaluate the development of NDBS energy and carbon footprint research, and helps to incorporate socio-economic analysis into NDBS physics-based models to improve the efficiency and reliability of such models for future research and practice. © 2024 The Authors","Carbon footprint; Energy consumption; Non-domestic buildings; Socio-technical review; Stock modelling","Building stocks; Carbon emissions; Energy; Energy-consumption; Global energy; Non-domestic buildings; Socio-technical review; Sociotechnical; Stock models; Technical reviews","J.

Prognostics and health management (PHM) is a viable solution for achieving PdM by evaluating the health condition and predicting the remaining useful life (RUL) of industrial assets. The advancement of digital technologies has facilitated the implementation of PHM through two distinct methods: life consumption monitoring (LCM) and system health monitoring (SHM) methods. Both PHM methods can be applied utilizing knowledge-based and data-driven approaches. This paper comprehensively reviews the application of knowledge-based and data-driven approaches in LCM and SHM methods. After the review, the strengths, weaknesses, and potential advancements of the knowledge-based and data-driven approaches are analyzed. It also assesses the benefits and drawbacks of LCM and SHM methods and clarifies how these two methods are deployed in real-time PdM. This paper is valuable for academics seeking guidance in establishing and improving PHM models. In addition, it provides practitioners with new insights into practical ways to address challenges encountered in PHM and PdM projects. © 2024 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers","Artificial intelligence; Predictive maintenance; Prognostics and health management; Remaining useful life; Surrogate models","Maintenance; Data-driven approach; Health monitoring method; Knowledge based; Life consumption monitoring; Predictive maintenance; Prognostic and health management; Remaining useful lives; Smart manufacturing; Surrogate modeling; System health monitoring; Knowledge based systems","S.

To handle such a huge amount of data, more servers in a data center or more data centers are required which means more energy consumption and CO2 emissions. Hence, energy efficiency in cloud computing is one of the major concerns. This survey provides a comprehensive review of energy-efficient software techniques. The techniques can be broadly classified into two categories: Energy-aware Resource Management Techniques and Energy-aware Data Management Techniques. For every category of resource management and data management, we explored the main idea, test dataset, and experimental environment.

To delve into the mechanisms of health insurance fraud between doctors and patients, this study employed evolutionary game theory to construct a model that comprehensively considers moral hazard, fraud cost, reward, punishment, bribes from patients, and other factors. Through theoretical analysis and numerical simulation of the model, the study discovered that the evolution of governance behavior in health insurance fraud is closely linked to its initial construction of the payment matrix and the initial selection of parameters for the payment matrix. Additionally, increasing penalties for fraudulent behavior, increasing the cost of fraud for both doctors and patients, and reducing moral hazard for both can effectively drive the final strategy of the system toward a non-fraudulent state. The study aims to provide valuable insights and recommendations to doctors, patients, and medical insurance institutions in establishing a sound governance environment for managing fraud behavior in health insurance.

IMR-based disks incorporate interlaced track layouts and energy-assisted techniques to dramatically increase areal densities. The interlaced track layout means that in-place updates to the bottom track require rewriting the adjacent top track to ensure data consistency. However, at high disk utilization, frequent track rewrites degrade disk performance. To address this problem, we propose a solution called Balloon to reduce the frequency of track rewrites. First, an adaptive write interference data placement policy is introduced, which judiciously places data on tracks with low rewrite probability to avoid unnecessary rewrites. Next, an on-demand data shuffling mechanism is designed to reduce user-requests write latency by implicitly migrating data and promptly swapping tracks with high update block coverage to the top track. Finally, a write-interference-free persistent buffer design is proposed. This design dynamically adjusts buffer admission constraints and selectively evicts data blocks to improve the cooperation between data placement and data shuffling. Evaluation results show that Balloon significantly improves the write performance of IMR-based disks at medium and high utilization compared with state-of-the-art studies. © 2023 by the authors.","data layout; data shuffling; hard disks; interlaced magnetic recording (IMR); interlaced translation layer (ITL); storage management","","S.

A large number of tasks are performed simultaneously in a cloud system, and an effective task scheduler is needed to achieve better efficiency of the cloud system. Task scheduling algorithm should determine a sequence of execution of tasks to meet the requirements of the user in terms of Quality of Service (QoS) factors (e.g., execution time and cost). The key issue in recent task scheduling is energy efficiency since it reduces cost and satisfies the standard parameter in green computing. The most important aim of this paper is a comparative analysis of 67 scheduling methods in the cloud system to minimize energy consumption during task scheduling. This work allows the reader to choose the right scheduling algorithm that optimizes energy properly, given the existing problems and limitations. In addition, we have divided the algorithms into three categories: heuristic-based task scheduling, meta-heuristic-based task scheduling, and other task scheduling algorithms. The advantages and disadvantages of the proposed algorithms are also described, and finally, future research areas and further developments in this field are presented. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Cloud computing; Energy consumption; Heuristic; Meta-heuristic; Task scheduling","Cloud computing; Energy efficiency; Green computing; Heuristic algorithms; Multitasking; Optimization; Quality of service; Scheduling algorithms; Cloud environments; Cloud systems; Cloud-computing; Energy optimization; Energy-consumption; Heuristic; Metaheuristic; Task-scheduling algorithms; Tasks scheduling; Unique features; Energy utilization","N.

In this sense, the present study investigated the Spatio-temporal dynamics of the carbonate system and the effects of the El Niño and La Niña phenomena over the Cabo Frio upwelling area. The physical characterization of the site was carried out through data on wind speed and sea surface temperature. Water samples were also collected during the oceanographic cruise onboard the Diadorim R/V (Research Vessel). From these samples, the parameters of absolute and practical salinity, density, pH, total alkalinity, carbonate, calcite, aragonite, bicarbonate dissolved inorganic carbon, carbon dioxide, partial pressure of carbon, calcium, and total boron were obtained. The highest average concentration of bicarbonate in S1 (2018 µmol/kg) seems to contribute to the dissolved inorganic carbon values (2203 µmol/kg). The values of calcite saturation state, aragonite saturation state, and carbonate were higher on the surface of each station (calcite saturation state = 4.80–5.48; aragonite saturation state = 3.10–3.63, and carbonate = 189–216 µmol/kg). The mean values of pH were similar in the day/night samples (7.96/7.97). The whole carbonate system was calculated through thermodynamic modeling with the Marine Chemical Analysis (AQM) program loaded with the results of the following parameters: temperature, salinity, total alkalinity, and pH parameters. This manuscript presents original data on the carbonate system and the ""acidification"" process influenced by the Cabo Frio upwelling, which directly depends on the El Niño and La Niña phenomena oscillations in the sea surface temperature. © 2023, The Author(s).","","","C.A.R.

This study focuses on the factors influencing consumer digital hoarding behavior on e-commerce platforms, aiming to provide management decision-making references for e-commerce enterprises to deal with consumer digital hoarding phenomena and improve transaction effectiveness. Based on the Motivation–Opportunity–Ability (MOA) Theory and through the Adversarial Interpretive Structure Modeling Method (AISM), this study systematically identifies and analyzes the influencing factors. The findings reveal that emotional attachment, burnout, and fear of missing out are the main motivational factors directly affecting consumer digital hoarding behavior, with strong interconnections between these factors. Perceived usefulness and platform interaction design are significant opportunity factors, indirectly affecting digital hoarding behavior by improving user experience and satisfaction. E-commerce platform convenience, anticipated ownership, perceived economic value, emotional regulation ability, auxiliary shopping decision-making, perceived behavioral control, and information organization ability are the foundational and intermediate factors. The research results emphasize the importance of understanding consumer digital hoarding behavior in the context of sustainable development.

The potential of these big data, particularly through machine learning (ML), to improve WWTP management is increasingly recognized. However, the costs associated with data collection and processing can rise sharply as datasets grow larger, and research on determining the optimal data volume for effective ML application remains limited. In this study, we comprehensively analyzed water quality, operational, and biological data collected from a full-scale WWTP over 970 days. Our results demonstrate that ML models can predict not only operational and water quality parameters (concentrations of dissolved oxygen and effluent chemical oxygen demand) but also the abundances of functional bacteria. Notably, we discovered that increasing data volume does not always improve model performance, and that data collection intervals do not need to be excessively small, as moderate intervals can still yield reliable predictions. These findings suggest that excessively large datasets may not be necessary for effective ML predictions in WWTPs. Overall, this study underscores the importance of optimizing dataset size to balance computation efficiency and prediction accuracy, providing valuable insights into data management strategies that can enhance the operational efficiency and sustainability of WWTPs. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Bacterial community; Big data; Long short-term memory; Machine learning; Wastewater treatment","dissolved oxygen; RNA 16S; Bacterial community; Biological data; Data collection; Data driven; Data volume; Machine-learning; Operational data; Short term memory; Waste water treatment plants; Water quality data; concentration (composition); efficiency measurement; machine learning; microbial activity; microbial community; wastewater treatment plant; water management; water quality; activated sludge; Article; big data; chemical oxygen demand; concentration process; data processing; DNA extraction; effluent; environmental sustainability; feature selection; information processing; long short term memory network; machine learning; microbial community; predictive model; waste water management; waste water treatment plant; water quality; Data accuracy","L.

However, the rapid surge in data production and the widespread adoption of cloud computing has resulted in an explosion of redundant, obsolete, and trivial (ROT) data within organizations’ data estates. This issue adversely affects energy consumption and carbon footprint, leading to inefficiencies and a higher environmental impact. Thus, this opinion paper aims to discuss the challenges and potential solutions related to the environmental impact of file storage on the cloud, aiming to address the research gap in “digital sustainability” and the Green IT literature. The key findings reveal that technological issues dominate cloud computing and sustainability research. Key challenges in achieving sustainable practices include the widespread lack of awareness about the environmental impacts of digital activities, the complexity of implementing accurate carbon accounting systems compliant with existing regulatory frameworks, and the role of public–private partnerships in developing novel solutions in emerging areas such as 6G technology. © 2024 by the authors.","carbon footprint; cloud storage; data management; digital sustainability","carbon footprint; complexity; data management; energy use; environmental impact; explosion; sustainability","H.

In energy-harvesting IoT nodes, energy management is critical for sustaining long-term operation. The proposed EFR approach integrates fuzzy logic and genetic programming to autonomously control energy consumption based on available resources. The study evaluates the system's computational performance, particularly focusing on processing time, RAM and flash memory usage across various hardware configurations. Different compiler optimization levels and floating-point unit (FPU) settings were also explored, comparing standard and pre-compiled algorithms. The results reveal computational times ranging from 2.43 to 5.23 ms, RAM usage peaking at 6.23 kB, and flash memory consumption between 19 kB and 32 kB. A significant reduction in computational overhead is achieved with optimized compiler settings and hardware FPU, highlighting the feasibility of deploying EFR-based energy management systems in low-power, resource-constrained IoT environments. The findings demonstrate the trade-offs between computational efficiency and energy management, with particular benefits observed in scenarios requiring real-time control in remote and energy-limited environments. © 2024 The Authors","Computational cost analysis; Energy management; Evolutionary fuzzy rules; IoT wireless sensor node; Low-power hardware optimization; Machine learning integration","Analog storage; Cost benefit analysis; Energy utilization; Flash memory; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy rules; Memory management units; Program compilers; Sensor nodes; Computational cost analyze; Computational costs; Cost analysis; Energy; Evolutionary fuzzy rule; Hardware optimization; Internet of thing wireless sensor node; Low-power hardware optimization; Lowpower hardware; Machine learning integration; Machine-learning; Wireless sensor node; Genetic programming","M.

However, heterogeneity of firms shows that undertaking environmental actions may be a major challenge, where success is not guaranteed. This is a central issue for the ecological transition of industry and, unfortunately, it is an issue that cannot be tackled by a unique perspective. Still, for a transition occur, at least an initial and an envisaged state should be defined; and a procedure for transition between both must be formalized. In this sense, the literature provides methods to define, yet not to enhance the ecological states of firms, exposing a critical inattentiveness in the process for transformation and, in industrial diversity. To stablish the foundation for dealing with these issues, this paper first synthesizes these methods —which showed a strong alignment to Information science and strategic sustainability, and proposes a matrix for transition, composed of an informational and ecological dimension. Later, this matrix is used to propose and fuel a preliminary methodology delineated by different firms. Both are oriented to guide the ecological transition of all kind of companies. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Data; Environment; heterogeneity; Information; Information Science; Knowledge; Strategy; Sustainability; Transition","Ecology; Data; Environment; Environmental action; Heterogeneity; Information; Knowledge; matrix; Proactivity; Strategy; Transition; Sustainable development","E.

Nowadays, the increasing interest in more detailed energy analysis for high-efficiency buildings requires more accurate calculation methods. In this work, starting from the hourly data of UNI 10349, the downscaling of a typical meteorological year was carried out by applying different mathematical and physical models for the main climate variables considered in the energy balance of a building to be used in dynamic simulation tools. All results were validated with one-minute measurements observed at the ENEA Research Centre in Rome, Italy. The results showed an MBE% of 0.008% and RMSE% of 0.114% using the interpolation spline method for the temperature, while, for the global horizontal irradiance, applying the novel sinusoidal–physical interpolation method showed an MBE% of −0.4% and an RMSE% of 31.8% for the 1 min observation data. In this paper, an easily implemented novel model for downscaling solar irradiance for all sky conditions that takes into account the physical aspects of atmospheric phenomena is presented. © 2023 by the authors.","climate data; downscaling; TMY","Italy; Lazio; Roma [Lazio]; Rome; building; climate change; downscaling; energy balance; interpolation; irradiance; simulation","G.

To address the need for leadership training in deep-sea expeditionary science, the Crustal Ocean Biosphere Research Accelerator (COBRA) launched a 14-week virtual Master Class with both synchronous and asynchronous components to empower students with the skills and tools to successfully design, propose, and execute deep-sea oceanographic field research. The Master Class offered customized and distributed training approaches and created an open-access syllabus with resources, including reading material, lectures, and on-line resources freely-available on the Master Class website (cobra.pubpub.org). All students were Early Career Researchers (ECRs, defined here as advanced graduate students, postdoctoral scientists, early career faculty, or individuals with substantial industry, government, or NGO experience) and designated throughout as COBRA Fellows. Fellows engaged in topics related to choosing the appropriate deep-sea research asset for their Capstone “dream cruise” project, learning about funding sources and how to tailor proposals to meet those source requirements, and working through an essential checklist of pre-expedition planning and operations. The Master Class covered leading an expedition at sea, at-sea operations, and ship-board etiquette, and the strengths and challenges of telepresence. It also included post-expedition training on data management strategies and report preparation and outputs. Throughout the Master Class, Fellows also discussed education and outreach, international ocean law and policy, and the importance and challenges of team science. Fellows further learned about how to develop concepts respectfully with regard to geographic and cultural considerations of their intended study sites. An assessment of initial outcomes from the first iteration of the COBRA Master Class reinforces the need for such training and shows great promise with one-quarter of the Fellows having submitted a research proposal to national funding agencies within six months of the end of the class. As deep-sea research continues to accelerate in scope and speed, providing equitable access to expedition training is a top priority to enable the next generation of deep-sea science leadership.

In recent years, data-driven methods in machine learning (ML) algorithms have provided beneficial results for many large-scale enterprises (LSE). However, ML applications have not yet been tested in SMEs, leaving a technological gap. Limited recourse capabilities and financial constraints expose the risk of implementing an insufficient enterprise resource planning (ERP) setup, which amplifies the need for additional support systems for data-driven decision-making. We found the forecasts and determination of inventory management policies in SMEs are often based on subjective decisions, which might fail to capture the complexity of achieving performance goals. Our research aims to utilize the leverage of ML models for SMEs within demand and inventory management by considering various key performance indicators (KPI). The research is based on collaboration with a Danish SME that faced issues related to forecasting and inventory planning. We implemented the following ML models: Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forest (RF), Wavelet-ANN (W-ANN), and Wavelet-LSTM (W-LSTM) for forecasting purposes and reinforcement learning approaches, namely Q-learning and Deep Q Network (DQN) for inventory management. Results demonstrate that predictive ML models perform superior concerning the statistical forecasting approaches, but not always if we focus on industrial KPIs. However, when ML models are solely considered, the results indicate careful consideration must be regarded, given that model evaluation can be perceived from an academic and managerial perspective. Secondly, Q-learning is found to yield preferable economic results in terms of inventory planning. The proposed models can serve as an extension to modern ERP systems by offering a data-driven approach to demand and supply planning decision-making. © 2023 by the authors.","forecasting; inventory management system; machine learning; reinforcement learning","","M.

However, with the operation of large and complex electromechanical systems (ES), the data generated gradually ages the status of components, and traditional PHM technology is difficult to solve the problem of electromechanical system components becoming more complex. Based on this, this study takes the hydraulic actuator cylinder as an example to construct a local component fault detection model. Firstly, fault data features are extracted using wavelet packet energy spectrum, and then a fault detection model is constructed based on support vector machine (SVM). In response to the shortcomings of SVM, a smooth support vector machine (SSVM) is proposed to replace SVM, and an improved crow search algorithm (ICSA) is used to improve SVM. Finally, an intelligent detection model for hydraulic actuator cylinder faults based on ICSA-SSVM was constructed based on the above algorithms. The experimental results show that the ICSA-SSVM model has the fastest Rate of convergence, among which, the positioning accuracy is 0.96, the fitting degree is 0.984, the fault detection accuracy is 99.16 %, the recall value is 94.52 %, and the AUC value is 0.986, all of which are better than the existing fault detection models. From this, it can be seen that the precise local anomaly localization technology for large-scale complex electromechanical systems based on the ICSA-SSVM algorithm proposed in this study can improve the efficiency and accuracy of fault detection, achieve accurate and intelligent detection of ES local anomalies, and have certain positive significance for the development of China’s industry. © 2023 Yaping Zhao.","anomaly detection; electromechanical systems; PHM; raven search algorithm; support vector machines","Anomaly detection; Cylinders (shapes); Hydraulic actuators; Learning algorithms; Mechanical actuators; Support vector machines; Anomaly detection; Complex electromechanical systems; Detection models; Electromechanical systems; Faults detection; Prognostic health managements; Raven search algorithm; Search Algorithms; Smooth support vector machine; Support vectors machine; Fault detection","Y.

Despite the technological advances and the increase in data collection in recent years, met-ocean data collection is still not trivial as it requires a high effort and cost. In this context, data resulting from commercial activities increasingly complement existing scientific data collections in the vast ocean. Commercial fishing vessels (herein fishing vessels) are an example of observing platforms for met-ocean data collection, providing valuable additional temporal and spatial coverage, particularly in regions often not covered by scientific platforms. These data could contribute to the Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS) with Essential Ocean Variables (EOV) provided that the accessibility and manageability of the created datasets are guaranteed by adhering to the FAIR principles, and reproducible uncertainty is included in the datasets. Like other industrial activities, fisheries sometimes are reluctant to share their data, thus anonymization techniques, as well as data license and access restrictions could help foster collaboration between them and the oceanographic community. The main aim of this article is to guide, from a practical point of view, how to create highly FAIR datasets from fishing vessel met-ocean observations towards establishing fishing vessels as new met-ocean observing platforms. First, the FAIR principles are presented and comprehensively described, providing context for their later implementation. Then, the lifecycle of three datasets is showcased as case studies to illustrate the steps to be followed. It starts from data acquisition and follows with the quality control, processing and validation of the data, which shows good general performance and therefore further reassures the potential of fishing vessels as met-ocean data collection platforms. The next steps contribute to making the datasets as FAIR as possible, by richly documenting them with standardized and convention-based vocabularies, metadata and format. Subsequently, the datasets are submitted to widely used repositories while a persistent identifier is also assigned. Finally, take-home messages and lessons learned are provided in case they are useful for new dataset creators.

In total, 1331 radioactive plumes were simulated with the objective to investigate the influence of changes in meteorological conditions in the performance of the monitoring network. For this purpose, the existing set of 84 monitoring stations included in the EUropean Radiological Data Exchange Platform (EURDEP) system in an area of 200 km around the source point is taken as reference. A methodology is presented for quantitative evaluation of the variability of the number of stations affected, the time of the first detection, the maximum registered and differences between the maximum values match in the network and in the simulated plumes. The results show seasonal differences in all of these parameters according to changes in the size and shape of the affected area due to meteorological conditions. There are large differences in the number of monitoring stations affected by the plumes, from 2 to 74; in the timing and location of the first alert given by the network, from 1 to more than 5 h and faster along the west-east axis from the source; and in level of maximum gamma dose rate detected by the monitoring stations, from 0.17 nSv/h in summer to 0.22 nSv/h in autumn.

The materials science community is no exception to these challenges as it heralds its new paradigm of data-driven science, which uses artificial intelligence to accelerate materials discovery but requires massive datasets to perform effectively. Hence, there are efforts to standardize, curate, preserve, and disseminate these data in a way that is findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR). To understand the current state of data-driven materials science and learn about the challenges faced with RDM, we gather user stories of researchers from small- and large-scale projects.

However, there is a lack of systematic research to analyze and summarize current DT-driven PHM applications and methodologies for industrial assets. Therefore, this paper first analyzes the application of DT in PHM from the application field, aspect, and hierarchy at application layer. The paper next deepens into the core and mechanism of DT in PHM at theory layer. Then enabling technologies and tools for DT modeling and DT system are investigated and summarized at implementation layer.

Recent studies on tool wear prediction predominantly apply deep learning-based data-driven approaches that use multivariate time-series signals from high-precision sensors. However, the reliance on these sensors incurs high installation and operation costs, posing practical challenges for small and medium-sized enterprises. This work proposes a novel deep learning-based approach that employs smartphone sensors to predict tool wear, which addresses the problems associated with smartphone sensor data, including higher noise levels and increased data and model uncertainties. To this end, this work develops various data-driven techniques for effective tool wear prediction and uncertainty quantification. First, a Kalman filter-based noise suppression method is applied to reduce undesired noise effects. Second, a novel uncertainty modeling method consisting of a Bayesian deep learning approach and a density output structure is proposed to capture both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties during tool wear prediction. The proposed method not only takes into account high noise levels and induced uncertainty, but also continuously quantifies and dissects predictive uncertainty. The proposed method's effectiveness is validated with real-world datasets from Ti-6Al-4V turning experiments under three different machining conditions. The comprehensive experimental results indicate the superior prediction performance of the proposed method compared to existing data-driven methods, probabilistic deep learning-based methods, and state-of-the-art methods. For each of the three distinct datasets, the proposed method provides the lowest mean absolute error (MAE) values of 2.5815, 1.2414, and 1.2269, with the highest R2 values of 0.9951, 0.9971, and 0.9982, respectively. © 2024 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers","Aleatoric uncertainty; Deep learning; Epistemic uncertainty; Machining; Smartphone sensor; Tool wear prediction","Aluminum alloys; Deep learning; Forecasting; Learning systems; Process monitoring; Ternary alloys; Titanium alloys; Turning; Uncertainty analysis; Vanadium alloys; Wear of materials; Aleatoric uncertainty; Deep learning; Epistemic uncertainties; High noise levels; Smart phones; Smartphone sensor; Tool wear; Tool wear prediction; Uncertainty; Wear prediction; Smartphones","S.

However, if our data management practices do not keep pace with progress in automation, this revolution threatens to drown us in unusable data. In this perspective, we highlight the need to update data management practices to track, organize, process, and share data collected from laboratories with deeply integrated automation equipment. We argue that a holistic approach to data management that integrates multiple scales (experiment, group and community scales) is needed. We propose a vision for what this integrated data future could look like and compare existing work against this vision to find gaps in currently available data management tools. To realize this vision, we believe that development of standard protocols for communicating with equipment and data sharing, the development of new open-source software tools for managing data in research groups, and leadership and direction from funding agencies and other organizations are needed. © 2023 The Author(s).

This paper explores the use of reinforcement learning algorithms for energy management in wearable IoT devices with energy harvesting applied in PLF scenarios. These devices monitor animal health, welfare, and location. Ensuring energy efficiency is critical due to the autonomous operation expected from these devices, which are often powered by limited-capacity batteries, and sometimes integrate energy harvesting systems. This study implements Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), and Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) algorithms to optimize energy consumption, creating an energy manager that adapts the duty cycle, frequency of data transmissions, and frequency of GPS executions based on weather conditions, orientation, and battery charge. Experiments demonstrate that reinforcement learning-based energy managers can effectively adapt consumption to different conditions. Using 10 000 episodes for training, the TD3 algorithm achieved the best overall performance. However, the PPO algorithm performed better during the autumn and winter seasons.

National, regional and international coastal/marine spatial data management exemplars demonstrate the need for clarity and certainty with respect to legal coastal/marine geographies (i.e. the basis for achieving security of tenure). Good practice in MSP is underpinned by four key pillars (use’, ‘value’, ‘development’ and ‘tenure’ (U,V,D,T)). The exemplars demonstrate the importance of currency in the statutory delineation of the coastline (HWM) and the spatial extent of the ‘coastal zone’ and tenure therein. The National Marine Planning Framework (NMPF), established in Ireland in 2021, provides the foundations for three of the interrelated management (U,V,D) pillars but those relating to ‘tenure’ are largely absent. Coastal/marine management platforms and data gateways have yet to be fully developed to meet emerging marine/offshore obligations while national data portals remain primarily terrestrial in focus. Early steps to create a MSP ‘one stop’ web portal (MarinePlan.ie) are rather limited when benchmarked against international exemplars that do include information related to tenure. This is particularly important as legislation enacting the adoption of the NMPF extends planning control and the marine consent authorisations process of Irish Coastal Local Authorities (CLAs) to also include the nearshore (three nautical miles seaward from High Water Mark (HWM)). To achieve MSP targets, information on coastal/marine legal and regulatory interests across the land/sea interface needs to match that currently available in terrestrial settings. © 2024 The Authors","Coastal and marine management systems; HWM; MSP; Spatial data; Tenure","Ireland; Benchmarking; Coastal engineering; Gateways (computer networks); Marine engineering; Network security; Portals; Coastal and marine management system; Coastal management; High water; High water mark; Management systems; Marine management; Marine Spatial Planning; Spatial data; Tenure; Water marks; coast; coastal zone management; data management; legislation; nearshore dynamics; spatial data; spatial planning; underpinning; Information management","H.

Next, their implementation within the open-source Python package Pymicro is presented, offering a high-level interface to build complex datasets through multimodal methodologies. Its capability to enable and automate complex workflows by building a digital twin of a commercially pure titanium sample under tension are then demonstrated. The digital twin contains microstructural and mechanical data for thousands of grains gathered on the same sample through synchrotron DCT and in-situ SEM experiments, as well as full-field numerical simulation. Finally, a local and statistical comparison between simulation and measurements of plastic slip and crystal rotation in hundreds of grains is shown, as an example of the contribution of this platform to multimodal data convergence and its importance for the development of a new generation of material models. © 2024 The Authors","4D experiments; Data management; Data standards; Microstructure digital twins; Multimodal mechanics","4d experiment; Complex workflows; Data management strategies; Data platform; Data standards; Material microstructures; Mechanics of materials; Microstructure digital twin; Multi-modal; Multimodal mechanic","H.

First, addressing the issue of extracting weak features from rolling bearing vibration signals, an optimized combination of variational mode decomposition (VMD) and Teager-Kaiser energy operator (TKEO) for signal reconstruction is proposed. TKEO is used to track the energy of high-frequency impulses in the original signal. The sparrow search algorithm is employed for optimizing VMD to perform high-frequency filtering, resulting in an optimized impulse energy signal. This signal is then multiplied with the original signal to enhance weak impulse features under noisy background. Next, a dual-channel network model for RUL prediction is constructed based on temporal convolutional network (TCN) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The one-dimensional time-series signal obtained after reconstruction and denoising serves as the input for the TCN network channel. Simultaneously, the signal obtained after reconstruction and denoising undergoes synchrosqueezed wavelet transforms to generate a two-dimensional time-frequency representation as input for the CNN network channel. This setup allows TCN and CNN to respectively extract temporal features from the vibration signal and time-frequency features from the spectrogram. By incorporating self-attention mechanisms, internal correlations between different features are fully explored, thereby enhancing prediction accuracy. © 2023 IOP Publishing Ltd.","dual-channel network; RUL; self-attention mechanism; signal reconstruction; weak feature extraction","Convolution; Deep learning; Extraction; Feature extraction; Forecasting; Roller bearings; Variational mode decomposition; Wavelet transforms; Attention mechanisms; Channel network; Convolutional networks; Dual channel; Dual-channel network; Features extraction; Remaining useful lives; Self-attention mechanism; Signals reconstruction; Weak feature extraction; Signal reconstruction","B.

A key aspect for determining their reliability and safety, along with reducing risk during operational deployment, is the structural integrity of tidal turbine blades. Therefore, a validated model for predicting the structural integrity of tidal turbine blades will aid in de-risking tidal energy technologies. In this study, a three-phase approach was used to formulate a strategy to predict the remaining fatigue life and residual strength of tidal turbine blades, over their operational lifespan. In Phase 1, the parameters influencing the structural properties of tidal turbine blades were identified based on the literature review, and the expertise in the field. Then, parameters were extensively studied and classified into four main impact groups, which include load conditions, design and manufacturing, degradation, and unexpected situations. In Phase 2, a data management strategy was formulated related to identified four impact categories and investigated the possible methods of analysing the data. In this context, finite element analysis of composite tidal turbine blades was identified as the most appropriate tool to comprehensively examine collected data, prior to comparing the results to the field and laboratory-based test data. In Phase 3, with the information gathered, as well as knowledge and experience in the field, a method for estimating the residual strength and remaining fatigue life of tidal turbines at each stage of their operation was formulated. The model will be validated using experimental testing datasets and used to develop vulnerability curves related to the remaining structural life of tidal turbine blades in the future. © 2023 European Wave and Tidal Energy Conference.","Fatigue life; residual strength; structural integrity; structural testing; tidal energy","Fracture mechanics; Pressure vessels; Commercial viability; In-phase; Prediction modelling; Reliability and safeties; Remaining fatigue life; Residual strength; Structural testing; Tidal energy; Tidal turbines; Turbine blade; Fatigue testing","","","European Wave and Tidal Energy Conference Series","27066932","","","","English","Proc.

The RDM strategy of a project is usually formalized as a data management plan (DMP)—a document that sets out procedures to ensure data findability, accessibility, interoperability and reusability (FAIR-ness). Many aspects of RDM are standardized across disciplines so that data and metadata are reusable, but the components of DMPs in the plant sciences are often disconnected. The inability to reuse plant-specific DMP content across projects and funding sources requires additional time and effort to write unique DMPs for different settings. To address this issue, we developed DataPLAN—an open-source tool incorporating prewritten DMP content for the plant sciences that can be used online or offline to prepare multiple DMPs. The current version of DataPLAN supports Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe projects, as well as projects funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG). Furthermore, DataPLAN offers the option for users to customize their own templates. Additional templates to accommodate other funding schemes will be added in the future. DataPLAN reduces the workload needed to create or update DMPs in the plant sciences by presenting standardized RDM practices optimized for different funding contexts. © 2023 by the authors.","botany; DMP; omics; phenotyping; planning; research data management","Digital storage; Finance; Plants (botany); Reusability; 'omics'; Botany; Data management plan; Data management strategies; Fundings; Management plans; Phenotyping; Plant science; Research data managements; Web based; Information management","X.-R.

In Spark, cache data are replaced by the Least Recently Used (LRU) Algorithm. LRU cannot identify the cost of cache data, which leads to replacing some important cache data. In addition, the placement of cache data is random, which lacks a measure to find efficient cache servers. Focusing on the above problems, a remote cache management framework (RCM) for the Spark platform was proposed, including a cache weight generation module (CWG), cache replacement module (CREP), and cache placement module (CPL). CWG establishes initial weights from three main factors: the response time of the query database, the number of queries, and the data size. Then, CWG reduces the old data weight through a time loss function. CREP promises that the sum of cache data weights is maximized by a greedy strategy. CPL allocates the best cache server for data based on the Kuhn-Munkres matching algorithm to improve cooperation efficiency. To verify the effectiveness of RCM, RCM is implemented on Redis and deployed on eight computing nodes and four cache servers. Three groups of benchmark jobs, PageRank, K-means and WordCount, is tested. The result of experiments confirmed that compared with MCM, SACM and DMAOM, the execution time of RCM is reduced by 42.1% at most. © 2022 by the authors.","cache management framework; cache placement; cache replacement; cache weight generation; Spark","","H.

It is introduced a novel methodology for designing a fuzzy-based energy management controller that autonomously determines the most suitable controller structure and inputs. This approach is evaluated using a solar harvesting IoT model that leverages historical solar irradiance data, highlighting the methodology's potential for diverse geographical applications and compatibility with low-performance microcontrollers. The findings demonstrate that the integration of GP with designed fitness function enables the dynamic learning and adaptation of control strategies, optimizing system behavior based on historical data. The experimental model showcases an ability to efficiently use historical datasets to derive optimal control strategies, with the fitness metric indicating consistent improvement throughout the learning phase. The results indicate that useful control strategies learned at a certain location may outperform a locally-trained control strategies and can be successfully re-applied in other locations. © 2024 The Author(s)","Cloud learning; Energy harvesting; Energy management; Evolutionary fuzzy rules; Internet-of-Things","","M.

Global changes are taking place quickly in all fields – manufacturing, service, agriculture, and external sectors. There are plenty of hurdles in the emerging technologies in agriculture in the modern days. While adopting such technologies as transparency and trust issues among stakeholders, there arises a pressurized necessity on food suppliers because it has to create sustainable systems not only addressing demand–supply disparities but also ensuring food authenticity. Recent studies have attempted to explore the potential of technologies like blockchain and practices for smart and sustainable agriculture. Besides, this well-researched work investigates how a scientific cum technological blockchain architecture addresses supply chain challenges in Precision Agriculture to take up challenges related to transparency traceability, and security. A robust registration phase, efficient authentication mechanisms, and optimized data management strategies are the key components of the proposed architecture. Through secured key exchange mechanisms and encryption techniques, client's identities are verified with inevitable complexity. The confluence of IoT and blockchain technologies that set up modern farms amplify control within supply chain networks. The practical manifestation of the researchers' novel blockchain architecture that has been executed on the Hyperledger network, exposes a clear validation using corroboration of concept. Through exhaustive experimental analyses that encompass, transaction confirmation time and scalability metrics, the proposed architecture not only demonstrates efficiency but also underscores its usability to meet the demands of contemporary Precision Agriculture systems. However, the scholarly paper based upon a comprehensive overview resolves a solution as a fruitful and impactful contribution to blockchain applications in agriculture supply chains.

For this purpose, four transects were conducted with an approximate length of 357 km (each one) through the platform and continental slope of the Sergipe-Alagoas sedimentary basin. Water samples were then collected in vertical profiles measuring from 5 to 1,799 meters depth, totaling 34 stations. Total alkalinity, calcium, and total boron were obtained analytically from these samples and by relationships with salinity. Speciation and concentration of the carbonate system were obtained by means of thermodynamic modeling. The results revealed that the empirical models used to calculate the concentrations of TA, calcium and total boron showed relevant variation when compared to the analytical values (TA: 5.0-6.5%; Ca: 0.4-4.8%; BT: 7.0-18.9%). However, the speciation and concentration of the carbonate system (CA, DIC, CO2-3, CO2(aq), ΩCalc, and ΩArag) obtained from the empirical values of TA, calcium and total boron did not differ significantly from those obtained analytically (0.0-6.1%). On the other hand, the parameters of pH, HCO-3, CO2-3(aq), CO2(aq), ρCO2, ΩCalc, and ΩArag varied significantly within the different water masses (p < 0.05). This study supports and encourages acidification monitoring projects in the South Atlantic Ocean, based on modeling the carbonate system parameters generated in real-time.

However, the presence of the superparamagnetic effect (SPE) limits further improvements in CMR disk density. To overcome this limitation, shingled magnetic recording (SMR) technology was developed. Based on the conventional hard disc architecture, this technology dramatically increases disk areal density by overlapping tracks. However, SMR disks produce unpredictable write amplification effects when performing random writes, which can severely impact I/O performance. To solve this problem, the industry then proposed interlaced magnetic recording (IMR) technology, which uses an optimized track layout and heat-assisted magnetic recording technology to effectively balance storage capacity and performance. In this paper, we first introduce the technical principles, disk types, and applications of SMR and IMR in detail, and quantitatively analyzes the write interference problem that affects their I/O performance. It then focuses on solutions to optimize their I/O performance at the device level, analyzing and summarizing the advantages, disadvantages, and optimization objectives of different strategies in each type of solution. An overview of device-oriented system-level and application-level optimization solutions, such as file systems, redundant array of independent disk (RAID) technologies, and databases, is then provided. Finally, possible research directions for optimizing the performance of SMR and IMR disks in the future are discussed. © 2024 Chinese Institute of Electronics.

Since these technologies present distinct advantages and tradeoffs compared to conventional DDR∗SDRAM, such as higher bandwidth with lower capacity or vice versa, they are typically packaged alongside conventional SDRAM in a heterogeneous memory architecture. To utilize the different types of memory efficiently, new data management strategies are needed to match application usage to the best available memory technology. However, current proposals for managing heterogeneous memories are limited, because they either (1) do not consider high-level application behavior when assigning data to different types of memory or (2) require separate program execution (with a representative input) to collect information about how the application uses memory resources. This work presents a new data management toolset to address the limitations of existing approaches for managing complex memories. It extends the application runtime layer with automated monitoring and management routines that assign application data to the best tier of memory based on previous usage, without any need for source code modification or a separate profiling run. It evaluates this approach on a state-of-the-art server platform with both conventional DDR4 SDRAM and non-volatile Intel Optane DC memory, using both memory-intensive high-performance computing (HPC) applications as well as standard benchmarks. Overall, the results show that this approach improves program performance significantly compared to a standard unguided approach across a variety of workloads and system configurations. The HPC applications exhibit the largest benefits, with speedups ranging from 1.4× to 7× in the best cases. Additionally, we show that this approach achieves similar performance as a comparable offline profiling-based approach after a short startup period, without requiring separate program execution or offline analysis steps.  © 2022 Association for Computing Machinery.","analysis; heterogeneous memory management; Profiling; runtime systems","Application programs; Dynamic random access storage; Information management; Memory architecture; Online systems; Separation; Analyse; Heterogeneous memory; Heterogeneous memory management; High-performance computing applications; Memory technology; Memory-management; Performance; Profiling; Program execution; Run- time systems; Benchmarking","","","Association for Computing Machinery","15443566","","","","English","ACM Trans.

Engg., The University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Canada","The emergence of blockchain technology has seen applications increasingly hybridise cloud storage and distributed ledger technology in the Internet of Things (IoT) and cyber-physical systems, complicating data management in decentralised applications (DApps). Because it is inefficient for blockchain technology to handle large amounts of data, effective on-chain and off-chain data management in peer-to-peer networks and cloud storage has drawn considerable attention. Space reservation is a cost-effective approach to managing cloud storage effectively, contrasting with the demand for additional space in real-time. Furthermore, off-chain data replication in the peer-to-peer network can eliminate single points of failure of DApps. However, recent research has rarely discussed optimising on-chain and off-chain data management in the blockchain-enabled IoT (BIoT) environment. In this study, the BIoT environment is modelled, with cloud storage and blockchain orchestrated over the peer-to-peer network. The asynchronous advantage actor-critic algorithm is applied to exploit intelligent agents with the optimal policy for data packing, space reservation, and data replication to achieve an intelligent data management strategy. The experimental analysis reveals that the proposed scheme demonstrates rapid convergence and superior performance in terms of average total reward compared with other typical schemes, resulting in enhanced scalability, security and reliability of blockchain-IoT networks, leading to an intelligent data management strategy. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Asynchronous advantage actor-critic (A3C) algorithm; Blockchain; Data management; Deep reinforcement learning; Internet of Things","Cost effectiveness; Deep learning; Digital storage; Distributed computer systems; Distributed ledger; Embedded systems; Information management; Intelligent agents; Internet of things; Multi agent systems; Peer to peer networks; Reinforcement learning; Reliability analysis; Actor critic; Asynchronoi advantage actor-critic (A3C) algorithm; Block-chain; Cloud storages; Data replication; Decentralised; Deep reinforcement learning; Intelligent data; Peer-to-peer networks; Reinforcement learnings; Blockchain","C.H.

With the rise in data traffic and network congestion, IoT devices with limited computational power and energy resources face challenges in analyzing, processing, and storing data. To address this issue, computing technology has emerged as an effective means of conserving energy for IoT devices by providing high-performance computing capabilities and efficient storage to support data collection and processing. As such, energy-efficient computing, or “green computing,” has become a focal point for researchers seeking to deploy large-scale IoT networks. This study provides a comprehensive Survey of recent research efforts aimed at achieving energy-efficient computing and green computing for IoT networks. To the best of our knowledge, none of the studies in the literature have discussed all types of green computing (edge, fog, cloud) and their role in enabling massive IoT networks in terms of energy efficiency. The article starts with an overview of computing technologies and then goes with a discussion of the empowering energy-saving techniques for computing (edge, fog, and cloud) environments including, energy-aware architecture, data aggregation and compression, low-power hardware, energy-aware scheduling, task offloading, switching on/off unused resources, virtualization, energy harvesting, and cooling optimization. This article is an outline of a roadmap toward realizing the vision of a sustainable computing environment for massive IoT networks; in addition, open the door for interested researchers to follow and continue the vision of Energy-Efficient Computing. © 2024 The Authors","Cloud computing; Computing; Edge computing; Energy efficiency; Energy harvesting; Fog computing; Green communications; Green computing; Green IoT","Computation offloading; Computing power; Data handling; Digital storage; Energy efficiency; Energy harvesting; Fog; Green computing; Internet of things; Cloud-computing; Computing; Computing technology; Data network; Data traffic; Edge computing; Energy-efficient computing; Green communications; Green IoT; Network congestions; Fog computing","Z.W.

This paper proposes a lightweight distributed data filtering model that combines broadcast variables and accumulators using RoaringBitmap. When the data in the two tables are not exactly matched, the dimension table Key is collected through the accumulator, compressed by RoaringBitmap and distributed to each node using broadcast variables. The distributed fact table data can be pre-filtered on the local server, which effectively reduces the data transmission and disk reading and writing in the Shuffle phase. Experimental results show that this optimization method can reduce disk usage, shorten the running time and reduce network I/O and disk I/O for Spark Join tasks in the case of massive data, and the effect is more obvious when the two tables have a higher incomplete matching degree or a fixed matching degree but a larger amount of data. This optimization scheme has the advantages of being easy to use, being easy to maintain and having an obvious effect, and it can be applied to many development scenarios. © 2023 by the authors.","Join; optimization method; RoaringBitmap; Shuffle; Spark","","Y.

Due to the lack of universally adopted data standards, image data collected from the marine environment are increasing in heterogeneity, preventing objective comparison. The extraction of actionable information thus remains challenging, particularly for researchers not directly involved with the image data collection. Standardized formats and procedures are needed to enable sustainable image analysis and processing tools, as are solutions for image publication in long-term repositories to ascertain reuse of data. The FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) provide a framework for such data management goals. We propose the use of image FAIR Digital Objects (iFDOs) and present an infrastructure environment to create and exploit such FAIR digital objects. We show how these iFDOs can be created, validated, managed and stored, and which data associated with imagery should be curated. The goal is to reduce image management overheads while simultaneously creating visibility for image acquisition and publication efforts. © 2022, The Author(s).","","Data Management; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; image processing; information processing","T.

Failures in data migration can result in data and service interruptions, financial losses, and reputational harm. This research aims to identify the specific challenges of a data management strategy, develop a comprehensive framework of data migration practices, and assess the efficacy of data validation and high availability for optimizing complex data and reducing the need to minimize errors during data migration. Combining trickle and zero-downtime migration techniques with a layering approach, a hybrid-layering framework was designed to encompass the entire spectrum of data migration techniques, beginning with system requirements and data transformation, rigorous functions, and evaluation metrics for sustainable data validation. The evaluation metric criteria are defined to evaluate data migration based on data consistency, integrity, quality, accuracy, and recall. The experiment demonstrated a real-world scenario involving a logistics company with 222 tables and 4.65 GB of data. The research compared various data migration strategies. The outcomes of the hybrid-layering framework’s examination of the final system’s functionality are satisfactory, emphasizing the critical importance of data migration sustainability to ensure data validity and high availability.

Unlike standard flowlines managed with temperature sensors on trees which provide limited information to the operator, Ærfugl Project implemented distributed flowline temperature monitoring, to allow effective mitigation against hydrate formation utilising active heating technology. The case study was a collaborative effort between the project's subsea umbilical, riser and flowline (SURF) Contractor (hereafter referred to as the COMPANY) and its subsidiaries, with support from the owner and operator of the Ærfugl development (hereafter referred to as the CLIENT). A pre-existing Alliance between the two companies worked to turn live project data into operationally valuable insights. The case study capitalised on monitored temperature data from the COMPANY's first functional 20km electrically heat-traced flowline (hereafter referred to as the PRODUCT). The PRODUCT is a subsea pipein-pipe system with electrical heating wires and fibre optics laid in the annulus. The fibres provide a temperature reading every metre along the flowline length via distributed temperature sensing (DTS). The DTS topside interrogator collects, processes and stores the data offshore, simultaneously visualising it for the offshore operator. The case study successfully extended offshore data acquisition to the cloud, further processing the data onshore to produce valuable outputs visualised on cloud-based dashboards. In collaboration with the operator, offshore data acquisition was successfully performed using Open Platform Communication Direct Access protocol, all the while maintaining the required cyber security. The data was then processed and correlated to the flowline design parameters to monitor and create temperature visuals, report thermal insulation efficiency, hence, aiding flow assurance and operations. Data is processed and visualised on dashboards within the COMPANY's bespoke digital delivery interface (hereafter referred to as the DATA INTERFACE) – a cloud-based platform where all stakeholders have a common integrated interface – showing status, profiles, trends, warnings, alarms, and operator recommendations where applicable. associated carbon emissions). More broadly, value is created by reducing unplanned production downtime, limiting (mono-ethylene glycol) MEG injection and flaring, validating and expanding operational envelopes by reducing design envelope conservatism, and allowing Subject Matter Expert-assessed, automated reporting. Furthermore, production and integrity envelopes through the product life cycle can be inherently validated, providing invaluable feedback and insight. Geared with such knowledge, conservatism in design may be reduced, system usage is improved and adjusted as the system ages and project delivery is enhanced. This paper highlights the value of useful data creation and processing resulting from constant monitoring of smart flowlines, allowing for improved product operation and development, building towards an actionable digital twin. Relying on a collaborative approach, a comprehensive field data management strategy highlights a critical tool and a repeatable/scalable process to provide value, supporting sustainability and efficient asset lifecycle management. © 2023, Offshore Technology Conference.","collaboration; dashboard; data; digital twin; Digitalisation; distributed temperature sensing; fibre optic; flow assurance; integrity; monitoring; operations; pipe-in-pipe; pipeline; smart flowlines; subsea; sustainability; technology","Cooling systems; Data acquisition; Efficiency; Ethylene; Fiber optics; Flowlines; Life cycle; Offshore oil well production; Sustainable development; Temperature sensors; Thermal insulation; Collaboration; Dashboard; Data; Digitalization; Distributed temperature sensing; Fiber-optics; Flow assurance; Integrity; Operation; Pipe-in-pipe; Smart flowline; Subseum; Technology; Data handling","","","Offshore Technology Conference","01603663","978-161399974-5","OSTCB","","English","Proc.

High dimensionality time-series data is collected during the system's operating time with the implementation of various sensors. To monitor the machining tool's RUL, a novel multisensor fusion method based on t-SNE-DBSCAN dimensionality reduction is proposed in this paper to aggregate the multiple sensor measurements into a healthy indication that represents the RUL. The robust MCD-Estimator is used to denoise multidimensional sensor data, flag the outliers, and enhance the robustness of the denoising process. The high dimensional statistical features are extracted, and the dimensionality is reduced with t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) according to the RUL labels, and optimum features selected by Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Application with Noise algorithm (DBSCAN). Ultimately, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is adopted for RUL estimation with multisensor fusion.

Researchers funded by the DOE GTO have contributed over 1,300 data submissions to the GDR. These data have been used to further advancements in geothermal science, economic analysis, exploration, research, development, and operational efficiency. The adoption of open data methodologies and a data management strategy that prioritizes universal open access and standardized, interoperable data have further increased the value of GDR data, making them available across a distributed network of data sharing partners and improving their utility to other industries and related fields, including material science and space exploration.

To address these challenges with using smart UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) delivery system as an example, we propose EXPRESS, a novel energy-efficient and secure framework based on mobile edge computing and blockchain technologies. We focus on computation and data (resource) management which are two of the most prominent components in this framework. The effectiveness of the EXPRESS framework is demonstrated through the implementation of a real-world UAV delivery system.

This large number of objects will generate a huge amount of data that is currently being processed and stored in the cloud. Fog Computing presents a promising solution to the problems of high latency and huge network traffic encountered in the cloud. As Fog's infrastructures are dense, heterogeneous and geo-distributed, managing the data in order to satisfy users demand in such context is very complicated. In this work, we propose a data management strategy called ‘RMS-HaFC' in which we consider the characteristics of Fog Computing environment. To do so, we proposed a hierarchical multi-layer model, on which we designed a migration and replication strategy based on data popularity. These strategies duplicate files dynamically and store them in different locations to improve the response time of users requests and minimize the system energy consumption without loading network usage. The strategy was evaluated using the iFogSim simulator and the experimental results obtained are very promising.  © 2020 - IOS Press and the authors.

Wave resource characterization is an essential step for regional wave energy assessments, Wave Energy Converter (WEC) project development, site selection and WEC design. The present paper provides an overview of a joint modelling effort by the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and Sandia National Laboratories on high-resolution wave hindcasts to support the U.S. Department of Energy’s Water Power Technologies Office’s program of wave resource characterization, assessment and classifications in all US coastal regions. Topics covered include the modelling approach, model input requirements, model validation strategies, high performance computing resource requirements, model outputs and data management strategies. Examples of model setup and validation for different regions are provided along with application to development of classification systems, and analysis of regional wave climates. Lessons learned and technical challenges of the long-term, high-resolution regional wave hindcast are discussed. © 2020, European Wave and Tidal Energy Conference.

Researchers have conducted many surveys on energy efficiency issues from different perspectives. All of the surveys can be classified into five categories: surveys on the energy efficiency of the whole cloud related system, surveys on the energy efficiency of a certain level or component of the cloud, surveys on all of the energy efficient strategies, surveys on a certain energy efficiency techniques, and other energy efficiency related surveys. However, to the best of our knowledge, surveys on energy-aware data management strategies in cloud-related environment are absent. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive survey on energy saving-aware data management strategies in cloud-related environments, such as data classification, data placement and data replication strategies. Compared to current existing reviews on energy efficiency in cloud-related environments, we firstly conduct the survey on the energy consumption problem from the data management perspective. Furthermore, we classify the energy-aware data management strategies from different perspectives. This survey and the taxonomy of the energy-aware data management strategies demonstrate the potential for reducing the energy consumption at the data management level of a cloud storage system, which will compress more space for energy reduction and finally achieve energy proportionality. Moreover, this survey and taxonomy on the energy efficiency issue from the data management perspective is an important supplement to current existing surveys on energy efficiency in cloud-related environments. © 2013 IEEE.","cloud storage system; data classification; data placement; data replication; Energy consumption; energy proportionality","Digital storage; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Environmental management; Green computing; Industrial research; Power management; Surveys; Taxonomies; Cloud environments; Cloud storage systems; Data classification; Data management strategies; Energy consumption problems; Energy efficient strategies; Energy proportionalities; Industrial communities; Information management","X.

A failure of complex or critical systems such as heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems installed in a passenger train carriage may adversely affect people or the environment. Critical systems must meet restrictive regulations and standards, and this usually results in an early replacement of components. Therefore, the CM datasets lack data on advanced stages of degradation, and this has a significant impact on developing robust diagnostics and prognostics processes; therefore, it is difficult to find PHM implemented in HVAC systems. This paper proposes a methodology for implementing a hybrid model-based approach (HyMA) to overcome the limited representativeness of the training dataset for developing a prognostic model. The proposed methodology is evaluated building an HyMA which fuses information from a physics-based model with a deep learning algorithm to implement a prognostics process for a complex and critical system. The physics-based model of the HVAC system is used to generate run-to-failure data. This model is built and validated using information and data on the real asset; the failures are modelled according to expert knowledge and an experimental test to evaluate the behaviour of the HVAC system while working, with the air filter at different levels of degradation. In addition to using the sensors located in the real system, we model virtual sensors to observe parameters related to system components' health. The run-to-failure datasets generated are normalized and directly used as inputs to a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) for RUL estimation. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology and approach is evaluated on datasets containing the air filter's run-to-failure data. The experimental results show remarkable accuracy in the RUL estimation, thereby suggesting the proposed HyMA and methodology offer a promising approach for PHM.  © 2013 IEEE.","deep learning; HVAC system; hybrid modelling; Prognostics and health management; railway","Air conditioning; Condition monitoring; Convolution; Deep neural networks; Health; Information management; Learning algorithms; Railroad transportation; Railroads; Systems engineering; Atmospheric modeling; Biological system modeling; Conditioning systems; Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Heating ventilation and air conditioning; Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system; Hybrid model; Predictive models; Prognostic and health management; Railway; Complex networks","A.

However, their informed and real-time responsiveness to the variations of renewable-based generation and, consequently, energy prices, is not possible without decision support solutions. This paper proposes a novel contextual learning approach for energy forecasting, which supports the decisions of Building Energy Management Systems (BEMS). The proposed forecasting approach includes a contextual dimension that identifies different observed contexts and clusters them according to their similarity. The identification of such contexts is used by the learning process of state-of-the-art artificial intelligence-based forecasting methods to select and adapt the most relevant data that is used in the training phase in each context. Forecasts for energy consumption, generation, temperature, brightness and occupancy are used by the BEMS to provide recommendations to the consumers and to support automated control of building devices. Real consumption, generation and contextual data gathered from several sensors in a building are used to validate the results, which show that the proposed contextual learning model improves forecasts of energy consumption, generation and other relevant factors for energy management in buildings. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Contextual learning; Demand response; Energy consumption; Energy management systems; Forecasting","Buildings; Decision support systems; Energy management; Energy management systems; Forecasting; Learning systems; Building energy management systems; Contextual learning; Demand response; Energy consumer; Energy forecasting; Energy prices; Energy systems; Energy-consumption; In-buildings; Real- time; Energy utilization","T.

Since the 1990s, my country's real estate industry has experienced three decades of rapid development. The average annual growth of commercial housing area is nearly 20%, and the average annual growth of housing prices in second-tier cities is 11.87%. However, in the rapid development, there are also many problems. For example, there are more and more phenomena such as unreasonable development, serious environmental pollution, and shortage of resources. At the same time, artificial intelligence has made great achievements in the development process in recent years, and it has continued to grow with technological progress and social demand. At present, China is in a transitional period of economic and social development, and the real estate industry is also facing huge challenges. In this context, research and development of traditional Chinese cities is very necessary and important. Therefore, how to effectively control and coordinate the real estate development behavior in the big data environment is one of the major problems that China is facing and needs to be solved urgently. This article uses questionnaire surveys and data analysis methods to understand the elements of real estate development strategies and analyze consumer purchase intentions through questionnaires. Randomly select 120 citizens of P city as the survey objects, and carry out a questionnaire survey. According to the survey results, most of the interviewees believe that the resource integration strategy occupies an important position in the real estate development strategy, and the big data management strategy also exerts its advantages. Most people believe that internal demand motivation is the most important, followed by the characteristics of real estate. It can be seen that real estate development must fully consider the actual needs of consumers and improve the development process to highlight the characteristics of real estate. © 2022 Yu Liu.","","Big data; Facings; Housing; Information management; Purchasing; Strategic planning; Surveys; Average annual growth; Development process; Development strategies; Housing prices; Industrial policies; National economy; Questionnaire surveys; Real estate development; Real estate industries; Real-estates; Regional planning","Y.

In alignment with best international practices, NAPIMS adopted an efficient asset-based management organizational structure to monitor the true performance of the entire assets within its portfolio. Having an overview of all assets serves as a roadmap/link to obtaining vital background information about legacy performance as well as plans and strategies. Over the years, NAPIMS had a less structured asset overview for producing and non-producing assets thereby, encumbering information access for budgetary and budget performance tasks. The deployed methodology ensures that investments meet the long- and short-term financial objectives and risk tolerance of NNPC and Nigeria at large.

Such misalignment leads to poor reconstruction quality. And effective automatic alignment approaches have been proposed. The alignment approaches are of good use for kinds of application scenarios such as X-CT and electron tomography. These scenarios demand not only high performance, but also that the component of automatic alignment can be integrated and upgraded in the whole solution. Thus, we propose an FPGA accelerator for state-of-the-art tomographic alignment algorithm. We first introduce a multi-ray access approach that modifies the order of data access for easier on-chip data management. Making use of BRAMs on FPGAs and effective local data management strategy, data reuse is reinforced, and data transfer latency with DRAM is covered by computation. Also, we introduce an FPGA-customized processing engine at a low cost to improve data throughput. Moreover, a streaming structure with multiple paralleled PEs further improves the performance of our algorithm. Experiments demonstrate that our accelerator achieves a 44. 5x speed-up for the state-of-the-art alignment on Xilinx ZCU102 over a 16-thread multicore CPU implementation, and a 1. 60x speed-up with 7. 8x energy reduction over an OpenCL implementation on Nvidia Titan V. © 2020 IEEE.","","Alignment; Computers; Data transfer; Electric impedance tomography; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Information management; Alignment algorithms; Application scenario; Automatic alignment; Electron tomography; Mechanical imperfections; Reconstruction quality; Three-dimensional tomography; Tomographic reconstruction; Computerized tomography","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","978-172815803-7","","","English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

The proposed architecture includes two main parts: 1) a deep convolutional neural network–multilayer perceptron (i.e., DCNN–MLP) dual network is utilized to simultaneously extract informative representations hidden in both time series-based and image-based features and to predict the RUL of bearings, and 2) the proposed dual network is embedded into the bootstrap-based implementation framework to quantify the RUL prediction interval. Unlike other deep-learning-based prognostic approaches, the proposed DCNN-bootstrap integrated method has two innovative features: 1) both 1D time series-based and 2D image-based features of bearings, which can multi-dimensionally characterize the degradation of bearings, are comprehensively leveraged by the proposed dual network, and 2) the RUL prediction interval can be effectively quantified without relying on the bearing's physical or statistical prior information based on bootstrap implementation paradigm. The proposed approach is experimentally validated with two case studies on rolling element bearings, and comparisons with other state-of-the-art techniques are also presented.

Generally, these gathered data are fed to the cloud for storage and further processing. The fog layer is incorporated here which acts like a bridge and performs communication between the cloud and IoT devices. This fog-derived IoT network offers services by effectively analyzing and computing information gathered by IoT devices with the help of sensors. Though, it has two major challenges energy and security. Further, fog computing aims to minimize the overhead of cloud computing to provide network services to satisfy secure data transmission. Nowadays, various security protocols have been suggested to overcome the security challenges in the existing fog-driven IoT models. Moreover, among various applications, the healthcare application requires an efficient data management strategy with maximum security, and thus, this paper aims to study the various research works on healthcare data management in Fog and IoT networks with different authentication protocols. The existing research works on Foga-ssisted healthcare data management systems in IoT are categorized for guiding the upcoming researchers in this field. Moreover, this review discusses different authentication protocols, performance metrics analyzed for validation and diverse tools used for implementation.

Energy needs for buildings are a large source of greenhouse gas emissions. As the energy needs of buildings strongly depends on weather patterns, this paper investigates how climate change may impact building heating and cooling loads, cost-optimal efficiency measures, and renewable energy production. Eight locations (Stockholm, Milan, Vienna, Madrid, Paris, Munich, Lisbon, and Rome) highlight differences among European climates. Weather datasets, commonly used in building energy simulations, are evaluated to see how climatic parameters have changed over recent decades. A future climate change scenario (with uncertainties) is analyzed for the year 2060. Weather files are used to drive building energy simulations for a standard baseline and a (Nearly Zero Energy Building) NZEB residential building whose design is improved using a cost-optimization approach. The analysis indicates most currently available weather datasets cannot assure reliable results with building simulations. We find the energy balance in European buildings will significantly change under future conditions: heating will decrease by 38%–57%, while cooling will increase by +99%–380% depending on location. In future NZEBs, efficiency measures to reduce cooling needs and overheating will be favored (e.g. roof insulation, window type, solar shading, envelope finishes), illustrating how improving energy efficiency will be more crucial within climate change scenarios. Compared to the baseline, more efficient NZEBs will enable renewable energy to much better cover building needs. There will also be advantages from reducing winter and summer peak demand, particularly when coupled to short-term electrical storage. When solar resource is limited in winter, more airtight, better-insulated NZEBs improve PV self-consumption. © 2021 The Authors","Building design; Building energy performance; Building modeling; Climate change; Energy efficiency measures; Nearly zero energy buildings (NZEBs); Renewable energy production; Weather datasets","Architectural design; Climate change; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Renewable energy resources; Structural design; Uncertainty analysis; Zero energy buildings; Building design; Building energy performance; Building model; Efficiency measure; Energy efficiency measure; Energy productions; Nearly zero energy building; Renewable energies; Renewable energy production; Weather dataset; alternative energy; building; climate change; data set; greenhouse gas; Energy efficiency","D.

However, most energy sources, such as sunlight, vary over time and do not guarantee constant power delivery to a device. In addition, these devices lack a battery with the necessary capacity to store enough energy to operate when harvesting is impossible. Thus, managing energy consumption becomes essential for any device to function correctly. This article proposes PPAASS (Practical Power-Aware Algorithm for Solar Sensors), a novel algorithm that allows devices to change their duty cycle to maximize the use of harvested energy based on the device's battery backup level and solar irradiance predictions. The algorithm was evaluated through simulations performed in Python and with different solar irradiance conditions depending on the season of the year. PPAASS shows a higher average duty cycle than other algorithms in the literature while maintaining a few changes in the duty cycle, which makes it ideal for constant monitoring applications. Furthermore, the implementation of the algorithm shows that the real-time duty cycle adaptation allows a device to react quickly to energy harvesting prediction failures and take full advantage of all the harvested energy. Our experimental results showed that PPAASS provided devices with power availability at all times while reducing to a maximum of 15% the time the system did not harvest all the solar energy because the battery was full.  © 2013 IEEE.","Energy harvesting; energy management; green IoT; Internet of Things; solar energy","Computer software; Electric power transmission; Energy harvesting; Energy utilization; Forecasting; Internet of things; Photoelectrochemical cells; Secondary batteries; Sensor networks; Solar panels; Solar power generation; Solar radiation; Battery; Duty-cycle; Energy; Energy harvesting sensors; Green IoT; Performances evaluation; Power-aware; Prediction algorithms; Solar panels; Solar sensors; Solar energy","J.J.

The objective of this project is to evaluate spatial and temporal changes in water quality and model the impacts of climate change on baseline water quality, now and into the future. To date, this project has standardized and aggregated more than 800,000 water quality records from more than 16,000 unique sampling sites, spanning 8 decades. This two-year process has highlighted a number of challenges with compiling a nation-wide database for research applications under the current model of water quality reporting in Canada. In light of these challenges, this commentary will highlight our observations as well as provide insights to inform future standardization of water quality reporting. This is particularly timely given the proposed development of a Canada Water Agency (CWA), whose goal is to promote collaboration between water management authorities, subject matter experts, and citizen scientists to “keep our water safe, clean and well-managed”.

Methodologies for PHM are either model-driven, data-driven or a fusion of both approaches. Data-driven approaches make extensive use of large-scale datasets collected from physical assets to identify underlying failure mechanisms and root causes. In recent years, many data-driven PHM models have been developed to evaluate system's health conditions using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) algorithms applied to condition monitoring data. The field of AI is fast gaining acceptance in various areas of applications such as robotics, autonomous vehicles and smart devices. With advancements in the use of AI technologies in Industry 4.0, where systems consist of multiple interconnected components in a cyber–physical space, there is increasing pressure on industries to move towards more predictive and proactive maintenance practices. In this paper, a thorough state-of-the-art review of the AI techniques adopted for PHM of engineering systems is conducted. Furthermore, given that the future of inspection and maintenance will be predominantly AI-driven, the paper discusses the soft issues relating to manpower, cyber-security, standards and regulations under such a regime. The review concludes that the current systems and methodologies for maintenance will inevitably become incompatible with future designs and systems; as such, continued research into AI-driven prognostics systems is expedient as it offers the best promise of bridging the potential gap. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Algorithm; Artificial intelligence (AI); Engineering systems; Machine learning (ML); Predictive maintenance; Prognostics and health management (PHM); Remaining useful life (RUL)","Condition monitoring; Decision support systems; Failure (mechanical); Health; Large dataset; Learning algorithms; Maintenance; Systems engineering; Artificial intelligence; Engineering structures; Engineering systems; Machine learning; Predictive maintenance; Prognostic and health management; Remaining useful life; Remaining useful lives; Sensor hardware; Machine learning","M.

Efficient and reliable management supports the aggregation and sharing of heterogeneous network resources. First of all, in order to achieve reliable and efficient access to heterogeneous network resource identification, an architecture model of a heterogeneous network identification analysis system is proposed. Secondly, in order to improve the efficiency of resource management and analysis, a resource registration process and analysis process are designed. The registration process of heterogeneous network resources includes four key steps: applying for registered resources, generating identification for user resources, sending a registration identification request, and identification registration. In order to improve the efficiency and reliability of authentication control, an attribute-based access control strategy is proposed to control the authentication of the gateway. In the experimental part, in order to verify the correctness of the analytical results, the analytical results of the algorithm in this paper are compared with the preset results. From the three dimensions of heterogeneous network resources exceeding the effective service time, not being allowed to be accessed, and the absence of resource identification, the correctness of the analytical results is verified. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Heterogeneous network; Power Internet of Things; Resource management","Authentication; Blockchain; Efficiency; Gateways (computer networks); Information management; Internet of things; Natural resources management; Resource allocation; Analytical results; Block-chain; Efficient analysis; Efficient managements; Network resource; Power; Power internet of thing; Registration process; Resource management; Resources based; Heterogeneous networks","S.

To accomplish this task, data-driven Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) is introduced as an asset performance management framework for data management and knowledge extraction. However, acquired data come generally with quality issues that affect the PHM process. In this context, data quality problems in the PHM context still an understudied domain. Indeed, the quality of the used data, their quantification, their improvement techniques and their adequacy to the desired PHM tasks are marginalized in the majority of studies. Moreover, many PHM applications are based on the development of very sophisticated data analysis algorithms without taking into account the adaptability of the used data to the fixed objectives. This paper aims to propose a set of data quality requirements for PHM applications and in particular for the fault detection task.

The traditional random replication strategy cannot provide high data reliability, and the traditional FTS approach does not consider the impact of data heat on the whole system. In this paper we propose a dynamic replication factor replication scheme based on fault-tolerant set named DRF-FTS. In our approach we classify data into different types based on data popularity and use fault-tolerant sets generated by the algorithm to restrict the placement for different types of data. Experimental results show that DRF-FTS has high data reliability (much higher than the widely used random replication strategy) and improves read performance by 14% compared with the traditional FTS approach. © 2021 IEEE","Cloud storage system; Dynamic replication factor; FTS; HDFS; Replica strategy","Classification (of information); Digital storage; Outages; Cloud storage systems; Data reliability; Dynamic replication; Dynamic replication factor; Fault-tolerant; FTS; HDFS; Replica strategy; Replication factors; Replication strategies; Fault tolerance","Y.

An efficient framework based on big data technology can bring new solutions. Some excellent frameworks have been proposed, which provide efficient organization and management of EO data. However, they are not optimized for data distribution in the storage environment. In this letter, an optimized EO data management strategy is proposed. Different horizontal scaling strategies are designed to explore the optimal scheme of EO data distribution. The MapReduce parallel computing model was used to test the performance of data retrieval in the experiment. The results show that the proposed strategy contributes to the efficient organization and arrangement of data. Remote sensing (RS) data blocks can be evenly distributed to different shards according to the time characteristics and hash characteristics of the strategy, and the logical index of the data reduces the time consumed by the routing process. This distributed management mode that achieves load balancing provides a framework foundation for parallel computing. Therefore, the framework with an efficient strategy can improve the performance of data management.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.","Data retrieval; Earth observation (EO) data; horizontal scaling strategy; parallel computing","Digital storage; Information management; Observatories; Parallel processing systems; Remote sensing; Routing algorithms; Data distribution; Data retrieval; Distributed database; Earth observation data; Horizontal scaling; Horizontal scaling strategy; Indexing; Load management; Parallel com- puting; Routings; data management; optimization; parallel computing; performance assessment; remote sensing; Big data","J.

Furthermore, motivated by IoT, studies of local distributed mobile devices attract attentions of both industry and academia in recent years. However, existing storage systems cannot manage data and support the QoS of mobile services well. This paper presents LKSM, a light weight key-value storage system, which can be deployed on either one node or multiple nodes. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first attempt to propose key-value store in this scenario. We carefully analyze the challenges when designing the system on mobile clusters, and further propose RDS for addressing. With the help of RDS, LKSM achieves the goal of lower latency, better scalability, and higher availability. Furthermore, based on RDS, a novel data management strategy is presented, which successfully avoid energy holes of mobile clusters and achieves the tradeoff between performance and energy. We organize LKSM using a log-structured merge-tree and implement it based on LevelDB, an open source key-value storage system proposed by Google. Experiments on physical smartphones demonstrate that LKSM presents much higher performance compared with the ported LevelDB on mobile devices.  © 2008-2012 IEEE.","distributed databases; energy aware system; Mobile computing; real-time distributed","Compaction; Flash memory; Indexing (of information); Information management; Mobile computing; Mobile telecommunication systems; Open systems; Power management; Scalability; Smartphones; Storage as a service (STaaS); Application services; Data management strategies; Distributed database; Energy-aware systems; Key-value storages; Log structured merge trees; Performance evaluation; Real time; Distributed database systems","X.

Two-stage revision arthroplasty is currently the gold standard treatment for PJI and consists of infected implant removal, an accurate debridement, and placement of antimicrobial impregnated poly-methyl-metha-acrylate (PMMA) spacer. The use of antibiotic-loaded PMMA (ALPMMA) spacers have showed a success rate that ranges from 85% to 100%. ALPMMA spacers, currently available on the market, demonstrate a series of disadvantages, closely linked to a low propensity to customize, seen as the ability to adapt to the patients’ anatomical characteristics, with consequential increase of surgical complexity, surgery duration, and postoperative complications. Conventionally, ALPMMA spacers are available only in three or four standard sizes, with the impossibility of guaranteeing the perfect matching of ALPMMA spacers with residual bone (no further bone loss) and gap filling. In this paper, a 3D model of an ALPMMA spacer is introduced to evaluate the cause-effect link between the geometric characteristics and the correlated clinical improvements. The result is a multivariable-oriented design able to effectively manage the size, alignment, stability, and the patients’ anatomical matching. The preliminary numerical results, obtained by using an “ad hoc” 3D virtual planning simulator, clearly point out that to restore the joint line, the mechanical and rotational alignment and the surgeon’s control on the thicknesses (distal and posterior thicknesses) of the ALPMMA spacer is mandatory. The numerical simulations campaign involved nineteen patients grouped in three different scenarios (Case N◦ 1, Case N◦ 2 and Case N◦ 3) whose 3D bone models were obtained through an appropriate data management strategy. Each scenario is characterized by a different incidence rate. In particular, the observed rates of occurrence are, respectively, equal to 17% (Case N◦ 1), 74% (Case N◦ 2), and 10% (Case N◦ 3). © 2021 by the authors.

In most cases, this approach does not allow to see a big picture, as well as to identify bottlenecks. There is a need to develop a unified data management strategy, which will assess the value of IT technology, and ensure the adoption of effective decisions. This article highlights the conceptual issues of data management strategies in higher education, using the example of the university. The place of the data processing strategy within the university's information space is considered a map model for analyzing key issues for decision making. The basic principles of organizing a data strategy for the university are determined. There is also considered an approach to designing and implementing an information and analytical system on the Microsoft Power BI cloud-based business analysis platform, which integrates all disparate data from university's corporate information systems and transactional data sources. The analysis of reports of key business processes of the university is carried out, in which the formulation of research questions is shown, and there have been given conclusions to these issues. Introduction of the information and analytical system in the contour of the university's corporate information system will contribute to the early identification of bottlenecks in the organization of the educational system and prompt decision-making in a systematic and comprehensive analysis of the main business processes of the educational organization through building a data map and visualizing all statistical reports. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2020.","","Data handling; Decision making; Environmental technology; Information systems; Information use; Metadata; Sustainable development; Comprehensive analysis; Corporate information systems; Data management strategies; Digital transformation; Educational organizations; Educational systems; Information and analytical systems; Processing strategies; Information management","G.

In the Internet of Things (IoT), the energy resource becomes more critical. The transmission policy with the aid of a coordinator is not a viable solution in an IoT network, since a node should report its state to the coordinator for scheduling and it causes serious signaling overhead. Machine learning algorithms can provide the optimal distributed transmission mechanism with little overhead. A node can learn by itself by utilizing the machine learning algorithm and make the optimal transmission decision on its own. In this paper, we propose a novel learning Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol with learning nodes. Nodes learn the optimal transmission policy, i.e., minimizing the data and energy queue levels, using the Q-learning algorithm. The performance evaluation shows that the proposed scheme enhances the queue states and throughput. © 2021, The Author(s).","Energy-harvesting; IoT; Q-learning; Transmission policy","Energy resources; Information management; Internet of things; Learning systems; Light transmission; Medium access control; Reinforcement learning; Data management strategies; Distributed transmissions; Internet of thing (IOT); Medium access control protocols; Optimal transmission; Optimal transmission policy; Q-learning algorithms; Wireless communications; Learning algorithms","T.-J.

However, an adapted approach for data-driven PHM process implementation in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) has not been yet discussed. This research gap is due to the specificities of SMEs and the lack of documentation. In this paper, we examine existing standards for implementing PHM in the industrial field and discuss the limitations within SMEs. Based on that, a novel strategy to implement a data-driven PHM approach in SMEs is proposed. Accordingly, the data management process and the impact of data quality are reviewed to address some critical data problems in SMEs (e.g., data volume and data accuracy). A first set of simulations was carried out to study the impact of the data volume and percentage of missing data on classification problems in PHM. A general model of the evolution of the results accuracy in function of data volume and missing data is then generated, and an economic data volume notion is proposed for data infrastructure resizing. The proposed strategy and the developed models are then applied to the Scoder enterprise, which is a French SME. The feedback on the first results of this application is reported and discussed. © 2020 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers","Data quality metrics; Data-driven PHM; Industrial data management; PHM implementation strategy; Small and medium-sized enterprises","Information management; Data infrastructure; Industrial fields; Industrial revolutions; Management process; Novel strategies; Process implementation; Prognostic and health management; Small and medium-sized enterprise; Industrial plants","N.

Conventionally, it is determined by regression methods, which is time-consuming and may subject to limited prediction accuracy. To provide a better estimate, the machine learning models, artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM) and extreme learning machine (ELM), are assessed for the prediction of discharges of rectangular sharp-crested weirs. A large number of experimental data sets are adopted to develop and calibrate these models. Different input scenarios and data management strategies are employed to optimize the models, for which performance is evaluated in the light of statistical criteria. The results show that all three models are capable of predicting the discharge coefficient with high accuracy, but the SVM exhibits somewhat better performance. Its maximum and mean relative error are respectively 5.44 and 0.99%, and 99% of the predicted data show an error below 5%. The coefficient of determination and root mean square error are 0.95 and 0.01, respectively. The model sensitivity is examined, indicative of the dominant roles of weir Reynolds number and contraction ratio in discharge estimation. The existing empirical formulas are assessed and compared against the machine learning models. It is found that the relationship proposed by Vatankhah exhibits the highest accuracy. However, it is still less accurate than the machine learning approaches. The study is intended to provide reference for discharge determination of overflow structures including spillways. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Discharge measurement; Empirical solution; Machine learning; Sharp-crested weir","Errors; Forecasting; Information management; Mean square error; Neural networks; Predictive analytics; Regression analysis; Reynolds number; Support vector machines; Weirs; Coefficient of determination; Data management strategies; Discharge determinations; Extreme learning machine; Machine learning approaches; Machine learning models; Machine learning techniques; Root mean square errors; Learning systems","S.

In this sense, relevant data analysis processes arise for decision makers. Similarly, to perform decisionmaking analyses, multi-criteria and metaheuristic methods represent a key tool for such analyses. These analysis methods solve symmetric and asymmetric problems with multiple criteria. In such a way, the symmetry transforms the decision space and reduces the search time. Therefore, the objective of this research is to provide a classification of the applications of multi-criteria and metaheuristic methods. Furthermore, due to the large number of existing methods, the article focuses on the particle swarm algorithm (PSO) and its different extensions. This work is novel since the review of the literature incorporates scientific articles, patents, and copyright registrations with applications of the PSO method. To mention some examples of the most relevant applications of the PSO method; route planning for autonomous vehicles, the optimal application of insulin for a type 1 diabetic patient, robotic harvesting of agricultural products, hybridization with multi-criteria methods, among others. Finally, the contribution of this article is to propose that the PSO method involves the following steps: (a) initialization, (b) update of the local optimal position, and (c) obtaining the best global optimal position. Therefore, this work contributes to researchers not only becoming familiar with the steps, but also being able to implement it quickly. These improvements open new horizons for future lines of research. © 2022 by the authors.

In this work, we present a novel method for prognostics using multimodal data, i.e. both numerical and non-numerical data. The proposed method is based on the development of a multi-branch Deep Neural Network (DNN), each branch of which is a neural network designed for processing a certain type of data. The method is applied to a case study properly designed to reproduce the problem of prognostics using multimodal data by referring to the operation of steam generators. The results show that it is able to accurately predict future degradation level using multimodal data, outperforming other methods using fewer sources of information. © 2021 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers","Deep learning; Multi-branch deep neural network; Multimodal data; Prognostics","Deep neural networks; Numerical methods; Steam generators; Automatic analysis; Failure prognostics; Industrial systems; Inspection records; Multi-modal data; Neural network model; Numerical data; Sources of informations; Neural networks","P.
